    "## Sequence-to-Sequence Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Many kinds of problems need us to predict a output sequence given an input sequence. This is called a _sequence-to-sequence_ problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such sequence-to-sequence problem is machine translation, which is what we'll try here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea of sequence-to-sequence learning with neural networks is that we have one network that is an encoder (an RNN), transforming the input sequence into some encoded representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This representation is then fed into another network, the decoder (also an RNN), which generates an output sequence for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "![seq2seq](../assets/sequence_to_sequence.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the basic idea, anyway. There are enhancements, most notably the inclusion of an _attention_ mechanism, which doesn't look at the encoder's single final representation but all of its intermediary representations as well. The attention mechanism involves the decoder weighting different parts of these intermediary representations so it \"focuses\" on certain parts at certain time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another enhancement is to use a _bidirectional_ RNN - that is, to look at the input sequence from start to finish and from finish to start. This helps because when we represent an input sequence as a single representation vector, it tends to be biased towards later parts of the sequence. We can push back against this a bit by reading the sequence both forwards and backwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll work through a few variations here on the basic sequence-to-sequence architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "- with one-hot encoded inputs\n",
    "- learning embeddings\n",
    "- with a bidirectional encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention mechanism is not very straightforward to incorporate with Keras (in my experience at least), but the [`seq2seq` library](https://github.com/farizrahman4u/seq2seq) includes one (I have not tried it myself).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For sequence-to-sequence tasks we need a parallel corpus. This is just a corpus with input and output sequences that have been matched up (aligned) with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that \"translation\" doesn't have to just be between two languages - we could take any aligned parallel corpus and train a sequence-to-sequence model on it. It doesn't even have to be text, although what I'm showing here will be tailored for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to be boring - here we'll just do a more conventional translation task.\n",
    "\n",
    "[OPUS](http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/) (Open Parallel Corpus) provides many free parallel corpora. In particular, we'll use their [English-German Tatoeba corpus](http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/) which consists of phrases translated from English to German or vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some preprocessing was involved to extract just the aligned sentences from the various XML files OPUS provides; I've provided the [processed data for you](../data/en_de_corpus.json).\n",
    "\n",

At some point, despite showing courtesy and caution, we decide enough is enough and if we're going to reach a destination at a desired time, then we need to take action, regardless of how unsuitable or inconvenient a situation might appear. That sums up a need in your world now. Waiting won't change what needs to be done now. $\", \"^ Being aware of your own vulnerability could discourage you from allowing others access to your thoughts. Revealing emotions could be seen by you as giving others a perfect opportunity to manipulate them. Yet, to allow yourself to be truly heard and understood, your words must be underpinned with passion. This might require you to feel vulnerable briefly but at least one person needs to see this side of you if you're to persuade them or gain their trust. $\", \"^ Help often comes from unexpected quarters. It also has a tendency to arrive when we least expect it. You've probably grown used to the idea that you were unlikely to receive support where a cause close to your heart is concerned.

You could also convince yourself a seemingly extreme situation requires extreme measures. It's important you recognize your limitations and what is  and isn't  your responsibility now. $\", '^ Someone can confess something to you, something quite controversial. This can be flattering. You are one of those types of people who can see things like this as a credit, not a burden. However, do keep it to yourself. If you do let it slip to a mutual friend, it may do irreparable damage to the relationship. Others may neither approve of any indiscretion. $', \"^ Many problems we experience are due to poor or non-existent communication. We make assumptions. We make pre-judged assessments in terms of who's doing what. Your biggest headache can be swiftly resolved by opening lines of communication now. Understanding needs to be reached about who's doing what and by when. Any concerns you have will be short-lived. $\", '^ You may have found yourself up against all sorts of obstacles, but a time has come when you can really start to look forward with greater confidence. So, if today, there are a few moments when you feel less than at your best, bear in a mind that a wonderful, big and expansive picture is shaping up, one which can open up your life in lots of different ways. $', \"^ When people say they can't do something, what they really mean is, they can do it, they just haven't learned how to yet! Some people will be adamant that they're incapable of doing something expected of them but if we probe a bit further, we discover they've made their minds up without ever really making any effort to try. Before you write off something you believe yourself unable to do, consider what might be achieved if you tried. A surprising result might just occur. $\", '^ The switch of Mercury into your relating sector can help to dissipate some of the tension that you have been experiencing over the last few days. If you have felt fearful, or stressed, this move can help you to stand back from events and adopt the objectivity for which you pride yourself upon. This is also good for making important appointments. $', \"^ A certain situation might appear to grow in complexity, causing you to allow the voice of doubt to become too loud or prevalent. However, even if it appears as if a situation is escalating in size doesn't necessarily mean a bigger solution demands to be found and applied. Have faith in the fact that the small but swift solution you're considering applying could be just as suitable now. $\", \"^ If we're asked if we would prefer to remain uncertain or know where we stand with a person or organization, then we usually opt for the latter. Yet, with uncertainty comes predictability. We grow used to not knowing the reality of a situation but, after a period of time, that starts to become almost comforting. You have recently been made uncomfortable through discovering the reality of something that has been confusing. Trust that you're in a much stronger position as a result. $\", \"^ You're inspired to share a vision of the future with others, but also accept they're entitled to their opinions, even if you'd prefer not to hear them. It's perhaps more important to you that others see the same possibilities you do, even if their methodologies differ to yours. There's something reassuring about knowing you and others are on the same page, even if you're reading it from different angles. $\", \"^ You might be aware of how alone you are in terms of tackling or overcoming a certain problem but try to connect with the part of you that wants to resolve it singlehandedly. You're not being selfish by doing so and involving a loved one or close companion with your quest could delay action that is begging to be taken immediately. If you feel you're being pushed a certain direction, then welcome it. You might not have taken a brave step otherwise. $\", \"^ Playing it 'safe' is an option. A situation can be left entirely as it is and could carry on as it is indefinitely. You know in your heart though that it cannot carry on as it is or has done. You're being encouraged now to take a risk that will undoubtedly require much focus and effort to achieve something special or wonderful. You have all you need to turn a situation around and gain much love, admiration and respect in the process. $\", \"^ If we must get drawn into a heated exchange, then we at least want to know the other person has presented a thought-through argument. When we sense their point isn't underpinned with the slightest bit of logic, then that makes things unnecessarily complicated. Even if you can spot the absence of logic in someone's argument, you can do yourself a favor by not prolonging a discussion by pointing it out. That revelation could come without your intervention. $\", \"^ Domestic and family matters could become focal points during coming weeks. The first sign of this could involve feeling reassured that a family member's reasons for changing their mind are due to finally seeing the logic you see in a situation. Someone's attitude shift might alter or delay a certain plan, but it won't take you long to see how both of you can benefit from their change of heart. $\", '^ You may decide to go out for a Festive drink, but as usual at this time, you are quite keen to take some time out to recuperate. You usually need to recharge you batteries by the time the year is drawing to a close. Dont ignore this no matter how many people invite you out. By all means be sociable, but you owe it to yourself to get back in touch with your needs. $', '^ However much you have decided that youd rather not take part in the frivolities, it really wouldnt be a surprise if you eventually did. Today, you may find yourself thinking that not only did you survive things, you really enjoyed yourself. Take comfort that the good time you had is a confirmation of the natural and very genuine humanity that you possess. $', \"^ People talk about 'leading by example'. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to confirm that people will generally follow those they believe can do themselves what they're expecting of others. Yet, we see evidence of people who believe themselves to be great leaders but refuse to get their hands dirty. You can gain support you want and need but, to get this, you need to be prepared to demonstrate your level of conviction in some way. It's time to show what's in your heart. $\", \"^ We often want to feel in control of situations but there are times where we don't want the responsibility that comes with being in control. By being in control, we are responsible for where what we're controlling ends up. Any captain of any ship will confirm that. But where you are steering something in your world, you could use a bit more help regarding precisely where you're meant to be steering it to. Allow new levels of clarity and focus to help with this. $\", \"^ People speak about 'misplaced faith'. Surely, as long as faith exists, we've reason to believe we're doing the right thing by investing faith rather than investing none. The saying though, relates to investing faith in something we perhaps shouldn't. You have reservations about why you shouldn't be optimistic but are about to find your faith has not been in any way misplaced! $\", \"^ You probably don't need me to tell you that someone is intent on taking up a contrary position with you. They're taking a stance with a differing opinion. They're picking a fight. Their reasons for doing so probably surprise you because a proverbial mountain is being made out of a hill created by tiny moles. You can strongly influence the outcome to this disagreement. Let someone have their say and make their point. Then you can relax. $\", '^ Today is perfect for all kinds of visualization, subliminal messages or hypnosis, so if you want to lose weight, stop smoking or improve your life, take this chance as it should work wonders. You may also get an insight into a problem that has been troubling you for some time. The more you get to know yourself the happier and richer your life will be. Maybe its time to take up meditation. $', \"^ Until recently, few - if any - of us were familiar with the phrase, 'alternative facts'. We have Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump's Counselor to thank for that interesting combination of words. As colorful and intriguing as someone's words might be now, your ability to recognize that which emerges from the back end of a bull is about to put you in a stronger position. Expect to see through a faade that conceals someone's true message. $\", '^ Despite your naturally bubbly personality, you can be shyer about sex and intimate relationships, than people think, and yes, even if there have been times when you have given the opposite impression. However, through to early next month, you could show a new and more assertive approach as Venus and Mars bring out the hunter gatherer in you! $', '^ You have been handling everyone very astutely. But there could be a jealous person around you, someone who is resentful of the prominence you have enjoyed this week and for the plaudits that have headed your way. Ah, well, thats one of the downsides of being in the spotlight, you become easier to target! Turn the other cheek - you are a victim of success. $', \"^ It's time to take a very deep breath, a brave step forward and a very calculated risk. You probably sense the situation you're in now is not a new one and you're likely to have been here before in the past. That was then. This is now. The past need not be an indication of the future and if you can summon courage to make a brave decision and act upon it, a reassuring outcome awaits. $\", \"^ Powerful emotions have been welling within you lately. You've found yourself cajoled and struggling with more than one concern or uncertainty that has been draining to say the least. Now, you find yourself having to make a difficult decision and, particularly, how much you should or shouldn't reveal to someone else. Trust that this will be a positive development. $\", '^ No matter what you are doing, your brain is usually busy working overtime. It cant help thinking about big things, small things, amazing things and mundane things  but it hardly ever stops. One way to combat this is to connect with your body by getting involved in sports, dancing, fencing or jogging. Your energy is diverted and your mind will be at peace! $', '^ For relationships, May can turn out to be a turning point month. The catch is, perhaps just not right away! And today you and a loved one can once more find yourselves at cross purposes. However, hope springs eternal, and your sense of humour can make a telling difference as can recognising your reluctance to sacrifice your airy independence. $', \"^ Your desire to free yourself from a certain arrangement could be strong, especially if it hinders your chances of making progress in another key area. However, it's also possible one clear benefit exists with remaining connected or involved, even if it's by a tiny proverbial thread. That's something you'd be wise to consider. Complete detachment might not be needed in ways you believe it to be quite yet. $\", '^ Finances are often a tricky issue at this time of year  as the cost of Christmas starts to bite home. So I bring you good news dear Water Carrier, in that some of the ideas that others seemed so negative towards only recently can now start to receive rave reviews. A job that you didnt hear back about, may also resurface, all in all, some good fiscal fortune is now due. $', '^ Almost everything we use a computer for asks us to enter a series of dots before we can access anything. In some ways, the cosmos is demanding you appease it before it can grant you access to something you truly desire. It wants to see you face a fear of some kind. Once done, you will have access to something that has so far been inaccessible. $', '^ Rather than focus on what you believe to be the best way to deal with a certain misunderstanding, it would be helpful to you and someone else if you focused instead on the cause of it and how a similar episode could be avoided in the future. Getting so caught up in making or defending a point could take your eyes off of the bigger picture than needs and deserves addressing  and how the matter might have been taken too seriously. $', \"^ At night, children fear the dark, open closets, cellars and what lurks underneath beds. Actually, many adults do, too. We're quick to tell children they needn't be afraid of those things yet we're not as resilient as we make ourselves out to be. You need to confront a fear now. Do it and your fear will disappear. $\", \"^ Some people are used to demanding others jump when told to jump. Such people can be seen as effective leaders when they're little more than bullies. Not every leader uses unsubtle tactics to get others to do as they're told. Some can be very persuasive cleverly and subtly. Gaining the support of others in some way now relies on you being clever and subtle. The spirit of teamwork needs you to nurture it with patience and sensitivity, not forcefulness or aggressiveness. $\", \"^ It's true that all sorts of deeply personal issues have been occupying you, but it's also the case that even if you are an Aquarian who likes solitude from time to time, there's another more gregarious side of your nature that you need to tap into too. This can start to come out now however, you may start by staging a gathering at your place. $\", \"^ Is doing nothing really an option? Is it possible to actually 'do nothing'? Even if we're not taking direct action, we're still giving thought to an issue and wondering if we have accurate understanding of it. We also understandably believe that, by doing nothing, we're doing little more than setting up a scenario whereby we will lose control over something we at least had some level of influence over. By leaving a situation alone, you're allowing more control to come to you. $\", \"^ We know the rule in life where respect is concerned surrounds having to demand it sometimes. Whilst a basic level of respect tends to exist between all of us, to get that 'little bit extra', there are times when we need to make clear to certain others how and why we are owed it. You. However, aren't starting from scratch in a way you might believe you are where commanding respect is concerned. You're right to blow a proverbial trumpet but is needn't be blown loudly, as you'll see. $\", \"^ You could be torn between releasing your ideas and visions excitedly and choosing to say nothing with fear playing a part in your thinking. Whether you think what you have to say will be laughed at or an unscrupulous individual will claim your ideas as their own, there appear to be more benefits than disbenefits to allowing others insight into what you're thinking or planning. You might have regretted doing so in the past but won't regret doing so now. $\", '^ This can be a magical week for your love life, but there are some potential catches. If you are smitten with someone new, dont be too quick to share any hard assets or even move in. There is real potential for confusion around joint finances, investments and property matters, so if need be, do seek a second opinion. $', '^ The Sun is raising your hopes as it now journeys through an adventurous area, asking you to challenge any tendency you have, of sticking to routine. Whatever new challenges, educational courses, or schemes you are contemplating, get in touch with what is driving these. If there is any wounded subconscious hurt behind these, things may not work out. $', \"^ 'Tendata via'. In case you thought that was the name of a song from 'The Lion King', it's Latin for 'the way must be tried'. This phrase is worth considering now. Where you suspect you've exhausted every option and possibility, there's scope to try something you haven't yet dared to attempt. Fortune, they say, favors the brave. Take a chance. Make an effort where you're convinced you'll fail and you could be more than pleasantly surprised. $\", \"^ Duty might call in some way that requires you to be practical and responsible which might prove annoying if you'd prefer to relax, kick back or let your hair down. A work or home-related obligation could delay any social plans, but you know this is a responsibility that can't be shirked. Work hard, play hard later! $\", \"^ How willing are you to take a risk? How prepared are you to embark upon a pursuit or quest that you have every reason to believe will result in failure? Ah, I think I hit the proverbial nail on the heard there. You are certain that failure is assured with whatever it is you're considering. The sky indicates clearly that you stand to be both pleasantly surprised and delightfully reassured. $\", \"^ Mercury has been in such a precise sector of your 'scope, it has helped you to be very dialed in to details, but there may have been some rawer edges too  especially in close ties. However, normal business can be resumed now, insofar as your ability to stand back and take other peoples opinions less personally. Listening and understanding is important. $\", \"^ Looking through the wrong end of a telescope can be daunting if we were hoping to be closer to something than what the image we're seeing is telling us. When we turn the telescope around and look through it properly, our perspective is restored. It's important now that you see something the way it should be seen and not how a certain other person's seeing it. Don't accept a situation at face value. Seeing it in such a way is only convenient for someone else. $\", '^ Whilst this can be a buzzy time of year for partying, your thoughts can also turn to fund raising for the causes and charities which are dearest to your heart. You, more than most zodiac signs, can be a humanist and the welfare of fellow people often registers on your radar. What you can do now, is use your network of contacts to make things happen. Get emailing! $', \"^ Mars continues to grind its way through your sign. On the 26th, it takes a two-month vacation. That's why it would be wise and timely to get a plan underway now before the planet of energy and ambition becomes weakened. Be willing to assess your reasons for investing effort in a specific way. Are you doing this for your benefit or to please a certain person? Now is the time to answer that question before you instigate the process to make it happen. If your heart's not truly supportive of your plan, then that energy could be put to better use elsewhere. $\", \"^ You might find yourself happily in your own space. If youre fortunate enough to be left to your own devices this can suit you perfectly. Yet despite this, there is still a very progressive and outgoing influence in your horoscope. There is a sense of growth and expansion. Things are unlikely to stay as they have been. You've an appetite for new experiences. $\", \"^ Not everyone gets an Aquarian. Do you sometimes find that people look at you quizzically when you've said something? Its not that you're strange, simply unique, but some people are happier keeping up with the Jones's and the latest trends. Because you stand out, it's hard for them to fathom. See it as a compliment not an insult! $\", \"^ You might be used to exerting your independence and want to encourage others to do the same. Anyone following your advice could discover how they've set restrictive boundaries for themselves and will be grateful to you for encouraging them to think bigger or bolder. They might even see that there has been a clear method all along to the way you operate! $\", \"^ It's time to look at a routine or way in which you do something on a daily basis. It's time to assess why you prefer to do something a certain way. Might this have suited you long ago and you're sticking with it out of habit? Perhaps a routine offers comfort and predictability in ways routines often do.  You're being encouraged to break a habit or introduce a new protocol. The first thing that needs to change is your attitude toward it and that's what the sky is helping with now. $\", \"^ We often hear people say they believe 'getting angry' is a great motivator. Martial arts experts say otherwise. They learned thousands of years ago how to make an adversary's anger work against them. The sky suggests you're feeling strongly motivated in a certain area now. Be sure that your motivation is driven by positive and heartfelt focus, not wasted and unnecessary energy. $\", \"^ Once again, we find you in an 'aim at nothing and you're guaranteed to hit it' scenario. You can choose to do nothing if you wish in the belief that summoning effort and faith is too tall an order. Do that and you can be certain of a particular result. But what if you achieved something pleasing with much less effort than you thought would be required? That's a question the cosmos is posing to you now and one that you should allow to inspire and motivate you. $\", \"^ When we reach the end of a long journey, there is always a brief period of relief and it is then that we often realize how weary we are from travelling. The same can be said about a situation in your world that has now come to an end and you're likely to be aware of how much energy it has required on your part. Be glad of what is no longer a responsibility. Something better is coming. $\", \"^ Who's the best person to offer help you need? By what criteria might you measure them? What qualities must they possess and what would you prefer to see in terms of experience? Gosh, that's starting to sound like a very complex selection process. How about we make it easier? The one person who can offer the best advice, encouragement and support can be found by looking in the nearest mirror! Trust what you're telling yourself in some way now. $\", \"^ 'Speak now or forever hold your peace.' Such words said at certain statutory engagements or ceremonies often instill a sense of unease. We're faced with an option to either speak up or say nothing and don't want to be faced with a regrettable situation because we chose to keep schtum. It's not easy to adopt an, 'if in doubt, then don't' strategy, either. Don't put off until tomorrow what you know really should done  or said  today! $\", \"^ 'To silence another, first be silent yourself'. That Latin proverb is intriguing. Perhaps it means, 'if you're opting to be the silent one and allowing someone else to speak, then at some point, they will have said all they wanted to say and cease speaking'. You feel the need to speak up for or defend yourself in some way now. Try the silent method before you do! $\", '^ What might seem very alluring on the surface could be something that needs closer or stricter examination. Where information seems hazy or facts seem elusive, be prepared to ask questions. You could end up committing yourself to something that is more time consuming or costly than it appears to be, so get as many solid facts as possible before doing so. Applying a bit of caution and reading any fine print could save problems from arising later. $', \"^ Your mind could churn many innovative ideas, but unless you want them to remain in the realms of thought, you'll need to make yourself a bit uncomfortable briefly. It's only by stepping outside of one or two comfort zones that you can get an accurate sense of potential that exists with some of what your brilliant mind conjures now. A combination of faith and courage will take you a significant step in a new and inspiring direction. Don't let your visions go wasted. $\", \"^ Even the most skeptical person with no faith whatsoever in magic will accept life often presents interesting and, at times unexplained, coincidences. We experience these but often overlook the very complex developments behind them that make them occur. Even if you don't believe in magic, you will likely struggle to dismiss the intriguing development that is unfolding now. It's been some time in the making. Perhaps, you grew tired of waiting. In any case, expect to be reassured and delighted. $\", \"^ We speak about revelations coming in 'flashes'. We tend to receive very brief glimpses into situations that bring a sudden but brief wave of insight. If these are supposed to be so helpful, why are they so brief and intermittent? Sometimes, that's all they need to be. A Eureka Moment awaits you. It might be brief and sudden but it's powerful enough to gain just enough insight to make a very clever and timely move. $\", \"^ We often hear people say 'be careful what you wish for, or might just get it'. This statement tends not to make us cautious or wary. It excites us. We are grateful for an opportunity to be surprised by receiving something we have long wanted. Then, we feel slightly despondent. We realize that what we've wished for might no longer present us with the challenge we've grown used to and enjoyed. In getting what you've wanted now, you are entering a new and exciting phase. $\", \"^ During our lifetimes, we tend to be more regretful about what we didn't do when we had the chance than what we did. A decision to do nothing probably brought a zero result and whilst that might have offered some level of comfort or reassurance on one level, further down the road, we wonder what might have happened had we shown initiative. Where you might believe you were wrong to take action in a certain way, you won't be waiting long for proof it was wise to take. $\", \"^ How often during our lifetimes do we believe someone else's observations about what's supposedly difficult? We can all think of times we were told we should brace ourselves for difficulty or hardship and then discovered what we were led to believe was tricky was surprisingly easy. Avoid taking someone's comments to heart now. They are underestimating your abilities and determination in some way. Just because they might have struggled doesn't mean you will. $\", \"^ 'You might say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one'. So sang John Lennon. Are dreams little more than chemical reactions and processes taking place in our brain when we sleep? There are those we wake up from wondering what on Earth occurred in our brains to create them and then there are dreams we create that fire us up and motivate us to make the most of our limited time on this planet. It's the latter that you are being encouraged to pursue now. $\", \"^ With a Full Moon Lunar Eclipse occurring in your solar sector of relationships and commitment, the urge to shake foundations of an agreement that might have had its day could be strong. You might feel a need exists to show how rebellious you're prepared to be if doing so helps make a certain point clear. What has been agreed between you and a certain person is about to become open for discussion and possibly re-negotiation. Just be willing to compromise where necessary. $\", \"^ Is it fair to say communication is more complex than it used to be? 'Text speak' presents potential problems to someone not fluent in it. There are infinitely more mobile phone numbers and email addresses than human beings so that leaves plenty of scope to send a text or email to the wrong person  and hope what was sent doesn't open up a whole new can of worms! Yet, I seem to be focusing on how integral to our communicating today's technology is. Perhaps, that's why you ought to consider a good old-fashioned, face-to-face conversation. Doing so might just eliminate potential problems. $\", \"^ As unexpected as many developments in life are, they usually happen for a good reason. We find ourselves wondering how we managed to allow such daft scenarios to happen but are often unwilling to accept they're the result of the decisions we made and actions we took. We also see the unexpected as something to be resented or feared. Whatever out-of-the-blue development arises now, it's likely the result of wise and strategic action you took recently. $\", '^ Certain interrelations can prove wonderfully upbeat, perhaps even surprisingly romantic. However, this can also be a time when people surprise you by being more outspoken about what they say. They may not mean this personally, but if they spot part of your attitude, they may not hold back in expressing their critique. Just what comes up may amaze you. $', \"^ If it's your birthday, youre in luck! This can be a great year to open up your life, but it will require discipline and application - as well as imagination. You may also find yourself with a moral dilemma today. Dont take short cuts. The law is the law, whether we agree with it or not, and whether it is a parking violation or something risqu, play it straight. $\", \"^ What is it they say about 'he who hesitates'? Apparently, he  or presumably anyone  is 'lost' when choosing to hesitate in any way. Yet, someone else said wise men declared 'only fools rush in'. So, by that rationale, we're lost if we hesitate or apply caution and impetuousness results only in being foolish. Therefore, middle ground is clearly needed. Balance needs to be found between hesitancy and impatience. That's your mission now and you will succeed. $\", '^ Celebrations seem due, as news you have been waiting for finally comes your way. But this is only the tip of the iceberg you may experience something like the domino effect as event after event seems to fall into place. The only slight problem may be that a legal complication wont be resolved just yet, but it wont hold up the rest of your plans. $', '^ Imagine a world with no traffic lights. Some people would say it would be preferable but even though we all experience frustration with being told when we can and cannot proceed, we all recognize the need for such a system sometimes. As keen as you are to proceed with a plan, try to understand why a delay exists. You can trust it exists for a necessary and valid reason. $', \"^ In what way have you had your eyes opened? You appear to have experienced a revelation of some kind and this has probably caused you to reassess a few plans and priorities. What you perhaps thought you wanted might not be as much a priority now. Where you thought you were going might not now be the destination you originally intended to arrive at. What you're experiencing now is clarity. You can expect to be in a stronger position as a result. $\", \"^ With a single word, we can make someone become defensive. All they require is a hint of confrontation and become primed to respond in whatever ways they deem appropriate. Normally, we don't want them to do this. We don't intend to sound accusatory, our words just come out that way. Be careful how you make a point to a certain person. Anything other than calmly and thoughtfully could result in them flying off the handle and prolonging an important discussion. $\", \"^ Does someone else have the upper hand? Are they in a seemingly stronger position than you to dictate how a certain situation is going to be from now on? It might appear they are in a stronger position but sometimes, people who speak loudest don't always know what they're talking about. Don't feel beholden or subservient just because someone appears intimidating. $\", \"^ If ever there was a time to connect with your spontaneous side or at least a part of you that is keen to expect the unexpected or embrace the unknown, it's now! Sure, some of your best-laid plans may need to be dramatically altered as a result of what arises unexpectedly, but look at what is fun, thrilling or exciting about this. It all leads to an intriguing opportunity or adventure that is worth seizing. $\", \"^ Oscar Wilde once said 'nothing is more aggravating than calmness'. Most living things on this planet need, and thrive, on routine. We know where we stand with what is predictable. However, somewhere in your world, a certain ongoing process has become unimaginative, restrictive and tedious. A tiny bit of chaos now will bring excitement and optimism to an area it's needed within. $\", \"^ What if there was a website or software available the provided answers to any problem? Would you trust such a resource? How reassured would you be that the solution was the 'right' one? No website or software will ever come close to matching answers our hearts are capable of providing. Where you feel uncertain now, it's important you trust what your heart is telling you. $\", '^ Resentment often has a long shelf life. Once it has been allowed the chance to live, it can hang around for longer than anyone expected it to. Somewhere in your world, resentment has outlived its welcome. It plays no part in what needs to be done  or said  where a certain relationship or arrangement is concerned. So, banish it. Recognize how negative its influence is. The way to do that is to be sensitive and accommodating. Being both will kill instantly what needs removing. $', \"^ Lately, it appears you have been playing a supportive role in some way to a certain person and it's possible you're about to become even more integral to a particular plan close to their heart. There might be a shortfall in terms of being recognized or appreciated but it appears at least one person you wish would have been more appreciative of your support is about to. Expect soon to feel more involved with something that has lately had you feeling isolated or detached. $\", '^ As Venus passes through its cycle there are three positions that it occupies that are particularly advantageous. From today, she moves into one of them. Whatever stresses and strains there have been, this can lead to a more soothing and peaceful atmosphere between you and others when achieving harmony seems so much better than being at odds. $', '^ There are numerous questions that can be asked where a particular scenario is concerned. There might even be no limit to how many questions you can ask, all of which an answer on some level can be received. What matters now though, is that you ask the right question in the right way. You can cut through so much of what emerges from the backside of a bull by getting to the heart of a matter and receiving an answer you need. So, pose your question carefully and thoughtfully. $', \"^ Is life meant to be a serious thing? Are we meant to evaluate ourselves constantly in order to ensure we're being responsible and disciplined in ways we're supposedly supposed to be? We can do that but are at risk of missing magic on offer to us every day. The message from the sky to you surrounds not taking certain matters so seriously and accepting that, with a bit of faith and a bit of magic being provided by the cosmos to you now, life can be a wonderful and amazing thing. $\", \"^ 'Ok, ok, I'll do it'. Those words often get spoken by someone unwillingly agreeing to something. You could be tempted to succumb or agree to something for the sake of an easier life. Doing so will cease constant persuasion coming from a certain person but if you have genuine doubts about agreeing to whatever it is, then you will have an opportunity soon to adjust the commitment to suit your needs in a better way. $\", \"^ Our brains process whatever information we give them. In the same way you can't expect a car to function properly by putting mud in the gas tank, it's essential our minds are given a constant supply of positive thoughts to process especially in light of the fact that we will eventually believe what we tell ourselves most often. It's time for you to reassess something you've convinced yourself to be true. It's likely to be less factual or positive than you believed it to be. $\", '^ You are entering an extended period of focus on events at home. You can find out a lot about the people who live with you, or immediately around you or even about your need for security. Yet there may be times when you feel a bit bottled up. Now is not one, but a revelation can still bubble to the fore, but it is one you can ultimately learn from. $', \"^ Wishing others would see what you see in a certain situation or accept your point of view will need more than wishing on your part to make either happen. However, do you possess the patience and effort levels that will be required from you? You might understandably feel that, if you have to educate or enlighten others, then you're wasting your time. In true Aquarian style, your thinking might be more advanced than those involved. With patience, they'll soon catch up with you! $\", \"^ Despite the availability to us of vast amounts of information on any subject under the sun, there's still much we don't know or can find answers to. This isn't a reason to feel negative or despondent. As keen as you are to find an answer or a way that must be tried to get a result, you'll make more progress by accepting that you haven't yet discovered or learned something. Note the keyword 'yet'. Despite your misgivings, you will make a breakthrough soon. $\", \"^ A reason to feel optimistic isn't unfounded, but you appear keen to turn thoughts into actions, particularly on work or professional fronts. You might also feel unsure how to attain similar levels of creative or possibly artistic fulfillment. Self-expression is becoming increasingly important, so be willing to look more closely at what you want to convey to the world and how you can do it. $\", '^ Banishing a certain complacent or stubborn attitude is something the cosmos is assisting with now. This could involve you understanding how appreciated you are and where you can reciprocate kind words or gestures. Where some increased mutual respect between you and at least one person is needed, it appears to be coming. $', \"^ Information that has come to light has possibly been unsettling or unnerving. That doesn't mean it is necessarily 'bad' but you do appear to be needing more time than you thought you would in order to understand a situation and why it may have occurred. Welcome what is being revealed now and accept why whatever has come to light wasn't available previously. $\", \"^ If superheroes or film action heroes existed, would they cry? Would they ever take time out of their hectic 'world saving' schedules to have a good old fashioned blub, maybe in secret somewhere? We don't tend to give thought to such things. We believe that, because superheroes and action heroes appear so strong, independent and capable, that they wouldn't display such emotion. Someone sees you similarly. In a subtle way, remind them you aren't superhuman. $\", \"^ Rarely, does any confide in anyone they don't trust. They would have to be desperate to share thoughts or feelings with someone they believed didn't have their best interests at heart. Yet, even if we do feel we can trust someone but, for whatever reason, are experiencing tension with them, we refrain from engaging in helpful or potentially healing conversations. Through restoring trust within someone you've distanced yourself from, a helpful healing process can begin. $\", '^ We can, without too much difficulty, make something straightforward appear more complicated. None of us does this because we want something to be more complex, we tend to make it so through fear or a perceived need to ensure every base is covered. Your keenness to make something simple more complex is understandable but unnecessary. Avoid the urge now. With little effort, you will see how straightforward something really is. $', \"^ If assistance or support is on offer to you in some way, then you might need to push aside some pride and accept it. Although you might believe you're the only one this side of Planet Zarg that truly understands your methodologies and what you're trying to achieve, you could be surprised and reassured at how quickly someone connects with your thinking. All you need to do is give them a chance to do so. $\", \"^ Sheep get bad press sometimes. People are often compared to them. This has something to do with apparent desire within sheep to follow each other without question. Yet, for any sheep to follow another, there must be a leader there somewhere. Initiative has to have been taken on some level. In some way now, you're aware of how you have no option other than to follow yet are equally aware of a difference you could make if only you were allowed to lead. This 'middle ground' won't last long. Your chance to take the initiative is about to present itself. $\", \"^ People are and always will be drawn to what's unusual or perceived to be far from 'the norm'. It's interesting though how they'll also set clearly defined limits surrounding their willingness to embrace or at least accept what  or who  is seen as 'different'. You might be confusing at least one person in your world through being unusual in some way but don't underestimate the level of intrigue that comes with this. It can definitely work in your favor now. $\", \"^ Many Aquarians can be armchair psychiatrists, or even professional ones! And your gift for probing beneath the surface is heightened today. Yet, if you are looking at your own financial situation, you might find it harder to admit to some treats that you give yourself. If you're keen to cut costs, one or two of these may need to go. $\", '^ A financial push and shove can be resolved, but it perhaps requires you to lower your expectations and for someone else to up their offer. Though you can be outspoken, you are also a natural democrat and realize that compromise can be important. Then again, if recent high living has seen you pile on the pounds, now would be a good time to knuckle down. $', \"^ Just when you thought you had an accurate understanding of a certain person, their behavior presents a need to reassess this. However, this change in attitude or opinion needn't be problematic. It's also possible they see aspects of your character or personality they've not seen before. Soon, the two of you could appreciate each other more as a result of your shared discoveries. $\", '^ Let your unique charms shine through naturally. Whether it is in a commercial setting or in romance, people will notice you and respond to you, but less so if you try too hard. So, have inner confidence. Also walk away from anyone too aggressive. Avoid all out strife, at all costs. This is also a day to steer clear of more intimidating places and districts. $', \"^ When we're hungry or thirsty, we know why we feel what we feel. We don't need explanations. We simply respond to whatever 'need' exists and replenish it. You're aware now of a need that exists in your world but are trying to justify it in some way. You feel inclined to weigh up what is 'right' or possibly 'wrong' with what you're feeling. Trust that it is right and act accordingly. $\", \"^ Some things in life are more interesting if they're unexplainable. When answers can't be provided, myth becomes perpetuated. Something similar can be said about an area of your world now. You aren't able to explain why a situation is occurring yet this fascinates you. You are aware of how you are entering unexplored territory but are right not to be fearful. $\", \"^ Some say that Air signs like yours, are unemotional, preferring instead to rationalize feelings but then in a way, at times that may be no bad thing. If you're someone who tends to be more detached, the interesting thing now is the feedback that comes from others. How folk see you, may be very different to how you see yourself. $\", \"^ You have tremendous cosmic support to pursue and fulfill a particular ambition and as clearly as you can likely see what's required of you to do so, your attention could be focused too intently on doubts or potential pitfalls. This negative thinking will be the cause of delays to otherwise solid plans. Have absolute faith that what's inspiring and motivating you is real and deserves to be appreciated, not doubted. $\", '^ Guess what Aquarius, the heavens have given you two guiding lights, one is your traditional ruler, the routine loving and responsible Saturn, the other in contrast, is the totally skittish Uranus and today this moves into Aries. For four months your nose for the unusual can see you sniff out all sorts of wonderful things. Prepare for an exciting journey. $', \"^ You can strike each item off your To Do List with time to spare, as long as distractions don't take your eye off of understood priorities. One major distraction could involve you disclosing certain thoughts or feelings to someone that takes your focus and efforts down an unhelpful route. Make a clear distinction between doing what needs doing and when a more appropriate time exists to reveal what's on your mind or in your heart. The latter might need to be less of a priority than you're making it. $\", \"^ Are you starting to get the feeling that, if a job is going to get done that you've left to someone else to sort that doesn't appear to be happening, then you're going to have to do it yourself? You might be understandably feeling frustrated but there are limits to how much you can or ought to involve yourself. Someone needs to keep a promise of sorts and they're about to. $\", \"^ Where a certain mystery is concerned, for as long as you're guided only by assumptions, you'll make limited progress with what you're trying to discover or unravel. However, once you start to untangle the threads, bit by bit, you'll start to see a clearer and more accurate picture forming. It's by involving others and asking questions to gain more crucial information that can help you to solve your puzzle, piece by piece. $\", '^ Your independence is a precious need. Its not that you are being unfriendly when you need time alone, for you are one of THE friendliest of zodiac signs. But today may be a time when you need to draw back a little. Reflect on whats what. You might feel moody. You might feel a bit melancholy. But equally you may feel fine. Whichever, dont be too hard on yourself. $', '^ A great day to draw up your Resume, updating it with things youve recently achieved, learnt or qualified with. If youre applying for a specific role you may want to modify your main draft so that you have one for this particular job. If you have a role in your local community, you can find your profile higher than usual. Plaudits may even come your way. $', \"^ You could be aware of pressure increasing in a particular area and might naturally resent this. Look closely though at what you stand to gain from allowing yourself to be pressured in a way you are. Does pressure you're experiencing not connect with a plan or aspiration you had anyway? You might believe you have all the reasons you need to create your own level of pressure to make something happen. A bit more from the cosmos in the right way won't hurt! $\", \"^ 'It's a great thing when you realize you still have the ability to surprise yourself. Makes you wonder what else you can do that you've forgotten about.' So said Kevin Spacey's character in the film, 'American Beauty.' His words could be appropriate for you, as you discover to your delight, how you possess an ability to surprise yourself with what you can do in some way. Not only can you amaze yourself with what you accomplish, but you can also inspire others by doing so. $\", \"^ Have you been overlooked? Ignored? Has someone forgotten to acknowledge how helpful or integral to something you have been? You have good reason for drumming your fingers in the hope that your efforts will be reciprocated. It's taking someone a bit longer than they'd prefer to make good on a promise or commitment. Just give them a bit more time. $\", '^ If anyone has underestimated you or thought your ideas were too flaky, your determination to be taken more seriously is set to be ratcheted up several notches. So, if you are putting the finishing touches to an ambitious project or a bid for new success, your timing is impeccable. The likelihood is that this will be a collective as well as individual effort. $', \"^ 'We could have been anything that we wanted to beand it's not too late to change'. So went the Bugsy Malone song. It's never too late to change our future. Right now, we sit within the present. The future has yet to arrive and is happy to be told changes are being made. You're being encouraged to make some changes and can trust that it definitely is not too late to make a few. $\", \"^ It amuses us to watch a dog chase its tail. It also amuses the dog to a point. Eventually, frustration sets in and the dog chooses to do something more constructive. In a similar way, you're being encouraged to look at an area of your world that is repetitive and becoming frustrating. The most constructive thing you can do now is accept help on offer to change it. $\", \"^ With lunar activity in your solar sector of relating and committing, you could find much of what you're thinking or feeling mirrored in someone else. The sky speaks of a delightful two-way connection bound to reassure you that you and someone else are very much on the same page together. Great minds don't just think alike, they make magic happen, as you're likely to see. $\", '^ A challenge presenting itself might appear familiar but demands you tackle it in a new and possibly unorthodox way. Once you get your unusual exploration underway, feelings of uncertainty or unease will ease. Circumstances were undoubtedly different last time this challenge presented itself, but current ones bode extremely well for you to apply knowledge and experience unavailable previously. $', '^ The dreamer in you is being constantly stirred by Neptune, as can the urban poet or the desire to move to live by the seaside. Whichever way this shimmering influence is coming out, it is trying to ease you away from just being your usual logical, sensible self. If you can allow yourself to be carried by its tide, its link with the loved up Venus can be special too. $', '^ Your eye for beauty can see you buy something for your home today, it may in itself be a valuable item, or it may be something you snaffle from a charity store or bric-a-brac which is inexpensive, but will make a great but unusual fit for your home. You can also have great success in mixing and matching old and contemporary items. $', \"^ Welcome to a wonderful period of transition. You are in what astrologers call a 'celestial limbo period', embarking upon a glorious process of change. Change, as we know, has some side-effects but you can deal easily with these. Insecurity soon disappears once upheaval dies down. Soon, you will feel stronger and more optimistic. $\", \"^ You might have believed you responded in a way you believed was appropriate where a particular situation that transpired not so long ago is concerned. It presented itself, you assessed it and your response brought closure in a way you felt it was needed. Now, it appears you're about to be grateful and even relieved that you did choose to react or respond in the way you did. You're being rewarded for your patience, perseverance and maybe even your discretion. $\", \"^ Many of us believe sometimes that if a job's worth doing, then it's worth doing ourselves. That doesn't mean we don't find ourselves wondering why we're having to invest more time and effort to make something happen than someone we thought was going to share the workload. Trust that you won't have to persuade someone to fulfill their side of a bargain for much longer. $\", \"^ There are times when we believe we know precisely how a certain person will react or respond. This often has much to do with our understanding of them as people or how we know how and why they reacted or responded in a certain way in the past. Sometimes, it involves both. Yet, people have an amazing ability to surprise us sometimes. We prepare ourselves for one reaction and discover we receive one we weren't expecting. When this happens, life can become noticeably easier. Someone's surprise reaction is about to make your life easier soon. $\", \"^ Most people, unless they know Capricorns celebrating birthdays on or around this time, have slowed down the 'giving' processes. You appear keen to continue giving in some way, particularly to those closest to you. You can help someone with a problem. You can help someone else with sound advice they probably won't have received elsewhere. The sky insists you have much to contribute and that any effort you make to do so will gladden your heart in a very big way. $\", \"^ Someone may come along with a great idea which seems to help resolve some or nearly all of the issues you have been facing. The Moon in Sagittarius brings a chance to create a cunning plan in partnership with a new associate who seems able to see your situation from a different perspective. It's possible they may spot a key, but crucial issue. $\", \"^ Guard against suspicion making itself felt in some way. Where a certain situation might appear cut and dried or 'adds up' in some ways but not others, it's likely this has little or nothing to do with deceit or someone believing themselves to be clever by attempting to pull proverbial wool over your eyes. It likely has much to do with the unavailability of information you need before drawing a certain conclusion. That information is winging its way to you now. $\", \"^ You could find yourself assessing in more detail than you have previously an arrangement with a certain person and how you view them or your relationship with them. Might it be possible you've seen them in an unrealistic way or perhaps placed them upon a pedestal in a way that was unfounded or unjustified? That doesn't mean your relationship with them is likely to deteriorate. It means you're about to see them and what they can offer you in a more helpful and realistic way. $\", \"^ We can sometimes feel a sense of excitement toward rediscovering something from out past. What got forgotten or possibly inadvertently left behind in the recesses of time can reveal itself as helpful in the present. It's often because we chose to favor another solution that one we were about to make use of got left behind. As you rediscover a way an aspect of your past can again play an important role in the present, you're putting in place a very solid foundation for the future. $\", \"^ 'A little less conversation, a little more action pleaseall this aggravation aint satisfactioning me.' Elvis Presley had no qualms about making clear to a certain person his frustration with their constant talking about doing something and showing no intention to make it happen. There is someone you wish would show some initiative and be less inclined to keep discussing what they intend to do. The sky promises a jolt that will spur them into action very soon. $\", \"^ 'You take it on faith, you take it to the heart, the waiting is the hardest part'. Tom Petty's lyrics are relevant to you now. Waiting is often the hardest part of any process. We're not all impatient by nature but when we need to see a result, we struggle sometimes with time needed for it to be achieved or manifest. You're beginning to wonder if you possess enough patience to continue with a cherished plan. The sky insists what you need and want is coming. Don't give up now. $\", \"^ Whenever we enter a hotel room, we make immediate and accurate assessments of the dcor, smell, furniture, view from the window, comfort of the mattress, age of the television and what state the bathroom has been left in. You're about to make an immediate assessment of a new situation. Your instincts could not be sharper now. $\", '^ Today can be as fun and upbeat as you want it to be. You just have to start out on the right foot. Begin by getting yourself in the right frame of mind. If you enjoy exercising you might want to go for a jog, a bike ride or a pleasant stroll somewhere beautiful. The more you empty your mind of worries and allow yourself to follow your bliss, the happier you will be. $', \"^ We all make predictions. We make many without realizing it. It is because we are used to certain routines that we can make accurate predictions that help us to get through each day. The prediction you're making now isn't based on previous experience or even fact. That's why it's making you nervous. Keep your prediction out of a complex scenario, for the time being anyway. $\", \"^ We all have clear ideas about what we need. It doesn't take us long to determine what's missing and what any gap or absence needs filling with. We can all be a bit too fussy sometimes, choosing to ignore something we feel doesn't quite fit the bill or measure up to what it is we feel we need. Something you need is trying to get your attention now but, because it doesn't appear in a form you thought it would arrive in, you're inclined to dismiss it. Look a bit more closely. $\", \"^ You have something helpful and interesting to contribute in some way but appear to have to wait until asked for input or assistance. That's fine. Biding your time has its benefits, especially if it helps you to confirm in your mind how you will react or respond when the time comes. It's also possible that, by watching developments in a certain area from the sidelines or at a distance, you're seeing something being overlooked by others. Watch and wait, for now. $\", \"^ You might need to adopt a more lighthearted attitude toward how you measure success in a particular area. What might appear to be going off on a tangent could be on course to hit its target. You're set to arrive at a particular destination, but perhaps not in the way you expected to. The cosmic equivalent of a sat-nav is working out the best route on your behalf. The only risk of disappointment involves you deciding to go off on a tangent! $\", \"^ There is a part of you that likes to speak the truth. Your truth may not of course, be the same as those of others, but you can be passionate about defending it. Yet if you speak out, especially about any kind of controversial subject, or one that's caused some upset, be aware of the ripples that you can create. In fact, anticipate peoples reactions. $\", \"^ Some parts of life can become heavy. Don't assume that everyone will play by the same rules that you do. Energy can be affected as this new month kicks off. If you are usually active, some aches and pains can creep in, or if you push too hard, you may sprain an ankle or pull a muscle. Pace yourself. A study course can however, be tempting for you. $\", \"^ If you feel you're being pushed a particular direction and don't have much say in the matter, then, rather than resist or question the process, welcome it. It's intended to help move you forward from a situation that has been confusing and uncertain into new territory that has tremendous potential to inspire you. It will require you to let something go but you'll soon see the benefits of doing that. $\", \"^ What will people think? What will one person in particular think? Does it really matter what anyone thinks? Such questions are likely to be ones you're asking yourself now in light of a decision you're considering making that might just cause a bit more controversy than you're willing to have to deal with. All that matters is, if what you're considering feels right, then it is right. $\", \"^ Aquarians are better at dealing with spontaneity than most other people. This is good news because if you're not already aware of an 'out of the blue' issue that has presented itself and requires you to 'turn on a dime' to sort swiftly, you will be aware very shortly. The issue might be connected with someone far away and require travel so have your passport ready. $\", \"^ Arguments, as Monty Python rightly stated, aren't the same as 'contradiction'. Anyone can be contradictory. That simply involves being awkward, unhelpful, unreasonable and refusing not only to consider someone else's point of view but to give them an opportunity to make it! You seem to be up against someone taking an opposing view just for the sake of it. Instead of standing your ground and insisting they listen to you, perhaps it would be wise to listen to them, even briefly? $\", '^ Ah, those annoying niggling, little thoughts. They find ways of getting our attention, and then we wave them away like irritating mosquitos. Fortunately, some niggling thoughts understand their importance and refuse to be ignored. If you surrender to one demanding your attention, then you could be glad you did. What you thought was irrelevant or unhelpful on the surface could reveal hidden potential beneath it. Be as open-minded as possible. $', '^ For such an imaginative and sometimes quirky zodiac sign, one of your great talents is to apply your creativity in a very tangible, and easy to understand way. Famous Aquarians? Oprah Winfrey - TV Host, or if youre sports orientated, Jose Mourinho, coach of Real Madrid. Bear this in mind, because originality and business acumen are not mutually exclusive now. $', '^ We need spaces, gaps and the occasional void in our world lest everything becomes too crammed, consistent or claustrophobic. There are even times when we look at something too closely and see nothing but a blur or mishmash of something that, with a bit of distance and space, we see more clearly. You can benefit in an important way by allowing breathing space to find its way into what has become too focused. $', \"^ There might be no escaping tedious tasks and duty will have to come before pleasure at this time. However, once you get focused and started on what needs doing, you could find you clear the decks more swiftly and easily than you envisaged. You'll have earned some quality 'you time' when the time comes to down tools and kick back. Just remain focused on that. $\", \"^ We can be oblivious to the difference between what we want and what we need. Once we make the connection and accept we might have been pinning our hopes unfairly on what we believe we want, we start to become aware of how and why our need deserves more attention. That's probably why a shift of focus is occurring now. Allow a bit more time for a need to become clearer and replace what you thought you wanted. $\", '^ You can be very kindly but there is also such a thing as being generous to a fault. This may come out in you now, a time when you can be at the heart of proceedings on a night out, and may want to make sure that everybody else is well cared for. Thats lovely, but will it be appreciated? Neither is this a time to gamble money you cant afford to lose Aquarius. $', \"^ We like to do favours. We enjoy being helpful where other peoples' goals or dreams are concerned but sometimes get a bit carried away. Through wanting to make someone happier or boost their morale, we make promises or commitments we know, deep inside, we can't keep. Be careful of doing precisely that now. $\", \"^ The past is playing a large part in how you're shaping your future now but the sky suggests you might be dwelling a bit too much on what has happened. How important, really, are recent events to where you are now and where you're heading? You have placated and reassured certain people regarding your intentions. You now have an excellent opportunity to 'formalize' an arrangement that has been uncertain. To do this, you must look forward, not backward. $\", \"^ Spontaneity has much to answer for. We're told opportunities should be seized and that whoever hesitates is 'lost'. A result of impulsive action is usually a need to have to redress an imbalance, or start again in some way. You're likely to be aware of impulsiveness shown in a particular area and how need exists to 'fix' something or invest time sorting it out. You haven't made an incorrect decision. You are simply being encouraged to improve something you truly need. $\", \"^ To have an 'easy life', all we have to do is accept everything life throws our way. This includes being subservient to certain people. All they want is for us to accept that their ways are right and not to be questioned. This, I suspect, isn't sitting well with you now. Someone has grown accustomed to your willingness to do as you're told. They key to releasing yourself from a certain person's power lies with your preparedness to state your case with honesty and a lot of sensitivity. $\", \"^ Some people refuse any kind of help when offered because they insist on achieving something singlehandedly. They want to be able to say they did something on their own, without help from anyone. That's admirable in some ways but much depends on how helpful the help being offered really is. If it represents something that can't be attained elsewhere or can accelerate a plan greatly, then it has to be worth considering. Don't let stubbornness or pride prevent you from accepting help where you really could use some now. $\", \"^ Legal matters or those of fairness and principle require careful consideration. If you are a bubbly but sometimes outspoken Water Carrier, it may be best to slow yourself down. To become more conscious of what you're feeling, and think before you speak. Having said this, dont let anyone browbeat you with their ideas - for someone may well try to do so. $\", \"^ A particular way of doing something might appear to be the only way and you might understandably believe you have no options where you could use a few. Let's not rule out completely the one way presenting itself but let's also consider the fact that you might be so focused on this way that you're unwilling to consider other ways that, on the face of it, might not be as appealing. If you're willing to open you mind to other possibilities, they will emerge. $\", \"^ It would be helpful now to look closely at where you are 'digging your heels in' and what your reasons for doing so are. Might you be choosing to be inflexible or defensive out of habit? Has a factor that was relevant and worthy of defending changed in some way since a particular dispute began? Be 'live' to the fact that your opposition to something could be a reflex response rather than one based on any up-to-date facts. $\", \"^ Who in your world has an ability to cause you to 'jump' when they say the word? It appears someone is pulling strings in a way that requires you to placate them or meet their demands. Part of you might be prepared to do so if it means you're reassured something will be done properly. Yet, you know there are limits to how obliging you're obliged to be. It might be time for a certain person to understand and respect this, too. $\", \"^ All solutions to any problem always require some level of logic to be applied to them. There is always a right way and a less appropriate way of devising solutions. On paper, these often appear a certain way. Yet, our hearts sometimes tell a different story. By all means, don't ignore a practical solution now, but make sure you give your heart the hearing it is desperate to receive. $\", \"^ When we drive a car, we need only concern ourselves with speed, other drivers, steering and braking. Lights indicate engine problems and we're able to reach our destination without focusing on smaller, intricate details. You're in control of something now. Your safe arrival is assured. Concentrate only on what you need to give attention to and nothing else. Distractions presenting themselves now will only serve to delay a process unnecessarily. $\", \"^ Without some level of fantasy in our worlds, life would be incredibly dull. We need some form of escapism, to focus from time to time on worlds of our creation. Sometimes, we focus so greatly on a fantastic outcome that lines become blurred between the world we wish we existed within and the one we exist within. Be 'live' to the fact that this might be something you're doing now. $\", \"^ The biggest obstacles to achieving success are those we invariably create ourselves. Most of these surround fear or lack of belief in what we're trying to achieve. Sometimes, just to make things worse, we believe what we're told by others in terms of what are and are not capable of. You know what you want to make happen. Don't be discouraged by others who don't understand. $\", \"^ Life does require all of us to suffer in silence sometimes. Even the most outspoken or gregarious person chooses to quietly take on responsibilities and deal with situations with little or no help from anyone else. When we find ourselves on the receiving end of a reward for our efforts in the form of release from what we've had to deal with, we question it. It's important you accept the appreciative gesture coming your way from a helpful and rewarding cosmos. You've earned it. $\", \"^ From a young age, we're told to 'tow the line' and accept rules and regulations. Of course, many exist for a very good and sensible reason but there are and always will be many we cannot fathom the logic behind their creation. Where you feel inclined to bend or disregard a rule or protocol, you might actually discover a benefit exists to doing so. There is a way you can free yourself from an unnecessary restriction. $\", \"^ We often have no choice other than to try and decipher the subtle signals life presents us with. This means we must become skilled in spotting clues that are presented in unobvious and unassuming ways. Given that some of the sweetest and most significant developments happen subtly, it means plenty of scope exists for magic to be at work where anything subtle is concerned. Permit yourself to be more 'tuned in' to this possibility. $\", \"^ You might feel it's necessary to accept a less than satisfactory offer or suggestion and could also be inclined to accept this for the sake of an easier life. It's possible that, the more you understand it, the more willing you'll be to accept it, especially if a certain person also seems to be so supportive of it. This could be a time to forgive, forget and move forward confidently. Push aside any reservations or resentments you've nurtured. $\", \"^ Can a certain situation carry on indefinitely? Possibly, although strong arguments exist surrounding anything carrying on in such a way. You've allowed it to continue in the way it has because you've been unsure how to present a solution. If you take a stand now and ring a change or two, you and someone else will benefit and be relieved from your doing so. $\", '^ How does grass appear on the other side of the fence? It likely appears greener. Why is that? Is it really any different from grass on your side of the fence? Probably not. The apparent difference might only surround the attitude of person tending it on the other side. Perhaps, there is a lesson you could learn from them. Before you consider making a drastic and unnecessary move, consider that a change in attitude might be all you need to improve a certain situation. $', \"^ Welcome the obstacle appearing now. Embrace confusion you're feeling. These are words I am certain you probably don't want to hear but if you can force a smile and adopt a positive attitude to what's transpiring now, you can make a small miracle take place. You're experiencing the delays because a situation is finally changing. It is transforming into something that will suit you infinitely better. That's why you need to remain optimistic. It won't last long. $\", \"^ You have a special touch that often brings success, even if the odds seemed stacked against this happening. Rather than rushing around trying to do as much as possible, try becoming very still and silent inside. Stay as peaceful as possible and you'll act from the basis of a deeper and more intuitive place. What happens can be profound. $\", \"^ An effective way of relaxing is to tense your muscles, count to ten and let them relax. All too often though, muscles get tensed but the second part doesn't happen! You've been priming yourself in more than one way for some time, whether it be for confrontation or perceived danger of some sort. The sky is urging you to recognize that you don't need to prime yourself in the same way any longer. You have an opportunity now to feel much more comfortable and optimistic. $\", \"^ When we invest huge amounts of effort and see nothing for it, we often question what we're doing. Rarely does it occur to us though that we might be pursuing something that we don't need or plays a less integral part than we believe it does in the bigger scheme of things. The sky speaks of such a revelation coming your way. Your efforts in a certain area haven't been in vain if they lead you to becoming clearer about what you truly need. $\", \"^ The excitement of pursuing something sometimes exceeds the thrill of attaining it. Somewhere in your world, you're required to invest effort toward improving an undesirable situation. You appear to prefer to be seen going through the motions of 'fixing' it than actually 'fixing' it. Trust that finding you have actually 'fixed' it will be more exhilarating than the 'fixing' process! $\", \"^ It's possible that, with a little help from your friends, a dream or cherished ambition can become much more within reach. This could have a connection with your home or a situation involving a property. If it's not you in the front line trying to resolve a property issue, then it could be a loved one or someone close whom you offer help or support to. Either way, you'll be enormously pleased with progress that can be made. $\", \"^ If you can sense more than one reason to dare to be different, then that's a dare worth rising to. You have a chance to exert your individuality in some way and owe it to yourself and the rest of the world to do so. Don't succumb to a belief that your voice won't be heard, even if it is conveying a point that others might need time to get to grips with. You have something very valuable and unique to say or offer. Rise to this challenge. $\", '^ If someone could see what you see in a situation, life would be infinitely easier. If someone could understand your reasoning behind a train of thought, life would also be infinitely easier. But such frustration is common among people born under the sign of Aquarius. You see more in situations than others do. You know why your train of thought is on much different levels to others. Soon, you will have a reason to celebrate these unique qualities rather than resent them. $', '^ The exchange taking place between you and another has massive potential to allay many of your concerns and bring a more than a ray of hope. You can, however, try too hard to accelerate a process that refuses to be hurried. In the same way a child might to eat their dinner quickly in order to get dessert, try to apply patience and appreciate where you are at currently. The rest will come, with time. $', \"^ What do you want? That's not always an easy question. Sometimes, identifying what we don't want can help us identify what we want. You're in the enviable position of ringing a few changes now. Something is being removed in your world because space is needed for something better. All you need to do is recognize what you want to fill it. $\", \"^ If you're anticipating a financial shortfall of some kind, then you have time to do something about it, especially if there could be more month left at the end of your money. Deceptive Neptune in your earnings zone suggests you might have something sneaky up your sleeve. Be aware that devious dealings are likely to be discovered! $\", \"^ Two heads, they say, are better than one. Collaborating to make something happen always brings a result that a single head might not have achieved on its own. The sky implies a way exists for you and another to work together to bring a delightful result where a shared objective is concerned. Before this can happen, it needs to be recognized that a splintered or divided effort won't bring as good a result as teamwork will. Let that revelation become clearer now. $\", '^ Good relationships between you and people from different age groups are possible today. You have a particular gift for communicating with younger people, mainly because you talk to them as an equal and this can boost your popularity, be it with friends at college or colleagues at work. But you can also understand the outlook of more traditional folk too Water Carrier. $', \"^ We know when we've been asked a daft question. We know when someone hasn't listened to what we've told them and hasn't thought through their question before asking it. They know we know what they've done. We know they now know what they've done. They  ok, that's enough. Before you defend a point, allow someone to recognize how ill thought through their argument is! $\", \"^ Logic might dictate that you're wise to err on the side of caution in some way where a promise of support is concerned. If it's a case of 'once bitten, twice shy' then it's understandable you should feel some reservations about what's being asked of you. Logic, however, needn't play such an integral part in what you're being asked to commit to. If you heed the barely audible voice that tells you all will be fine and you needn't be concerned, then all really will be fine. $\", \"^ Judges and juries often have difficult tasks surrounding being unbiased toward those that stand before them. So too, do those who defend such people. It is understood that decisions can't be made without weighing up fairly all available facts, even if all evidence points undoubtedly to someone being guilty. In a similar way, it's important you refrain from making judgment prematurely. You could find yourself surprised at how easy it is to misjudge a person or situation. $\", '^ Life looks very promising and you seem to be on top of the world. There is fun and laugher on the menu, yet also an issue that will encourage you to examine your beliefs. You may be presented with a situation in which you need to stick to your principles and show you have integrity. This may not be as simple, as it first seems. You will be put to the test! $', \"^ You could be tempted to go to great lengths to justify or defend yourself. Think though about what the net benefit of doing so will be. Are you concerned hundreds or thousands of people need to be made aware of a certain fact? I suspect you're dealing with considerably fewer people. In fact, I suspect there's one person you wish would get their facts straight despite your efforts to educate them. What you perceive as injustice is something that will die down without any encouragement. $\", \"^ We hear about people who are so skilled at something that they believe they could do whatever-it-is 'with one hand tied behind their back.' As long as something's done properly, most of us don't care if it involves one or two hands. You'd probably be a lot more impressed with someone's skills or abilities if they didn't try so hard to impress you. Be willing to explain that a bit more honesty and a bit less showmanship might be needed. $\", '^ A glimmer of hope could replace a concern, or at least make it less of a prominent thought. A black cloud hovering over your world could reveal that it intends to travel elsewhere. Momentum is about to work in your favor rather than create obstacles, and although you might need to give a process a gentle nudge or occasional steer, you can expect to feel reassured that something is finally moving in the right direction. $', \"^ Has someone lost their mind  or just missed a point in a very big way? To you, something couldn't be more obvious or straightforward. Someone else seems to see this differently and you're puzzled as to why and why it seems necessary for you to do some serious educating on a certain matter. There is something you need to protect now and this will require you to get someone you your side. Some gentle and clever persuasion will do the trick. You can do it. $\", \"^ We can be fiercely proud of our abilities to do things ourselves. We want pats on back to come our direction and for achievements to be noticed. And why not? If we've toiled and persevered to achieve something special, then want the world to know about it, not just for purely selfish reasons but to offer advice or steer others toward doing something similar. Be willing to share knowledge now. More than one person knows you're the best source for it. $\", \"^ There are times when we want a solution to be perfect in every way and achieve it. There are other times when we accept we will have to 'make do' with a less than ideal solution but accept it, provided it manages to achieve the bare minimum of what we want it to achieve. You can choose to be fussy if you wish but it appears you're likely to achieve a very pleasing result with considerably less effort than being overly fussy or craving perfection will achieve. $\", '^ Humans are, by nature, inquisitive creatures. We rarely simply accept something for what it is or take it at face value. We sometimes feel a need to look beyond something or someone in an attempt to identify something others may have missed or overlooked. Might our reasons for doing this stem from a perceived need to be self-protective in some way? Might that be the very reason why you feel obliged to look closer than necessary at a situation now? $', \"^ 'Don't stop 'til you get enough'. So sang the late, great Michael Jackson. You could be tempted to throw yourself into a certain plan and disregard completely the idea of stopping even when a desired result has been achieved. Knowing when you've had enough and when to stop are the biggest issues surrounding this. Be wise enough to know when both apply. $\", \"^ The saying 'throw enough mud and some of it will stick' refers to us adopting an attitude along the lines of 'if I go a bit overboard in terms of pursuing a particular plan, then I'm bound to get a result of some kind'. Might this attitude be one you're considering now? You could be thinking along unnecessarily excessive lines to make something happen. Trust that a pleasing development will occur with a much more sensible - and minimal - approach. $\", \"^ There are many benefits to being completely transparent with what you think or feel at this time. Conveying yourself authentically is an essential first step to gaining someone's support or at least getting both of you on the same proverbial page in some way. For this to happen, you and they must be motivated mutually to do so, and all that's needed is open communication on both sides to make it work. $\", \"^ Before you believe you've missed the proverbial boat or an opportunity has passed you by, don't be too quick to draw a certain conclusion or be too harsh on yourself. If effort and faith being invested in particular ways are in-line with your beliefs and a particular vision, then you'll soon discover how within reach a certain aspiration remains. Keeping your self-esteem and self-confidence levels high will ensure doubts don't creep in and present unnecessary obstacles. $\", \"^ We spoke not so long ago about a need on your part to refrain from putting too much emphasis on finer details contained within a situation and the message from the sky to you now is a similar one. If you haven't recently found yourself taking a keener interest in the medium to long term implications of a plan you're embarking upon, then you will do shortly. The short term benefits are clear but it is what you stand to gain further down the road that needs attention now. $\", \"^ We take much for granted in life. Given that none of us asked to be residents on planet Earth and were brought from a place many believe we return to, we have a right to expect certain conditions and situations are in place to facilitate our existence. As right as we might be to expect much in life, we know we should appreciate magic that exists within each and every situation. Expect soon to feel a sense of gratitude that could override what you've grown used to accepting for the sake of it. $\", \"^ Is what you're experiencing intended to act as a harsh reminder of lessons learned previously? The answer is no, it isn't. Although you might be experiencing a sense of dj vu now, particularly where one emotional attachment is concerned, you're very much in new territory that shouldn't be causing you to prime yourself. Trust that you can relax and deserve joy and fulfillment available within your new situation. $\", \"^ We often decide to 'chalk' certain experiences 'up to experience', as the saying goes. Instead of dwelling on what went wrong with a certain situation or focus on reasons why we believe we should feel dejected or disheartened, we choose to learn from the experience instead. There are times when it takes time before we can truly take something of value from such experiences. Now appears to be such a time for you. Expect to learn something truly valuable from a past error. $\", '^ Though everyone about may seem full of seasonal joy, you appear to be marching to a different beat. This is due to the focus on your spiritual zone. On the one hand an issue linked to the past may come back to haunt you, causing you to feel distracted. On the other you want to tap into the real meaning of this season aside from the commercial dimensions. $', \"^ Does a relationship feel imbalanced? You know better than I how something between you and someone is balanced unfairly in their favor. There also seems to be some level of acceptance on your part that is this acceptable. The sky doesn't speak of a need to address this if you're happy with the arrangement but it does indicate you have the ability to create balance if you're not. $\", \"^ We know we should only proceed with certain plans when we believe we're ready to do so. We often want to know every proverbial box has been ticked or we're armed with all information we would want or need to ensure the greatest chance of success. There are times though when fear or doubt cause us to believe we're not ready and more preparation is needed in some way. Have faith in the fact you are very prepared in every way to embark upon a plan close to your heart now. $\", \"^ You know a thing or two about doing things differently and limits that exist regarding how obliged you are to explain or justify your decisions or actions. However, the Aquarius Moon reminds you of the importance of being even less beholden to others' expectations now. How someone does something and how you do it is the result of two different mindsets being applied to the same task. Try to respect their approach, even if it appears to be far removed from your own. $\", \"^ Imagine planting what you thought were tomato seeds and discovering you'd grown potatoes. You achieved a result but not one you wanted. Imagine that you had, at some point, planned to grow potatoes anyway and through recognizing what went wrong with your original plan, could put that into action. It's important you don't become despondent now with a surprising result that differs from what you wanted but forms part of a bigger strategy. You haven't lost anything. $\", \"^ Pressure might be increasing in a particular way but rather than be resentful of it, try to look at how it's helping to push you a particular direction or take action in a way you might not have done otherwise. If you feel you're being pushed in a certain direction, then that's good news. Resisting it might only serve to delay progress that the pushing is in aid of. Smile. Be willing to do what might seem a chore. The sky promises a pleasing and possibly surprising result if you do. $\", \"^ 'Like' often attracts 'like'. We often underestimate how influential we are in terms of affecting outcomes. Just a change of attitude can cause us from being an 'unlike' to a 'like' and then we find ourselves delighted with progress we're making. Your existing attitude isn't helping you get something you need. Try pursuing it from another angle and you'll alter an outcome in your favor. $\", '^ If you are attending any kind of function or gathering today, your personality really can light up the proceedings. Contrary to popular perception, Aquarians are not always so comfortable in situations like this, with friends, no problem, but today any inhibitions that you might usually have, will just melt away and you can come across at your very best. $', \"^ Are you feeling slightly out of your depth? Do you perhaps feel that you have, in some way, been left behind? If you are, then that's exactly what you should be feeling because progress you're keen to make in a certain area will rely on you getting to grips with something you currently don't understand. You're being encouraged now to learn a new skill, trick or trade. Embrace this. $\", \"^ Do you care how you're seen by others? People say they don't but they do. Whether you like it or not, or are prepared for it or not, a rise in your status is coming. Other peoples' perceptions of you are changing. Trust that you need not do anything but relax in the knowledge you've earned this enhanced respect. $\", \"^ You might believe you know what's best for you, someone else or possibly certain others. To do what's best will involve instigating a change and it's here where your trepidation likely exists. You know what level of opposition or resistance you're likely to meet through even suggesting something changes. Don't believe you have much objection handling to do. Make your suggestion and you could discover it's met with more approval than you thought it would. $\", \"^ When we make heartfelt or altruistic gestures to others, do we do so to make someone feel belter or make ourselves feel better? Some could argue it doesn't matter why we make them, as long as we make them. That might be a reason why you needn't question the generous gesture you're keen to make in some way now. It's very much within your ability to gladden the heart of a particular person and you stand to benefit in a similar way from doing so. $\", \"^ Handling something delicately takes patience and skill. If we're aware something is fragile, then we consciously or unconsciously put one or two safeguards in place should we inadvertently drop it! Where some situations are concerned, if we know they also require careful handling, then we rarely struggle with coming up with an ideal way to do so. Trust that your idea of the best way to handle a sensitive situation in your world is right. $\", \"^ If you feel a need to question if you're deserving of what's developing now, stop for a moment to consider the question! Have you geared yourself up for a negative outcome and are wondering if it might be possible you were wrong to think in such a way? Was there not a very clear method within a plan that has brought you to precisely where you are now? That's enough questions. Don't feel a need to ask any yourself. Just trust that what's happening now is deserved. $\", \"^ When we highlight to others what we believe to be obvious, we don't always receive gratitude for doing so. Some people resent having to accept a situation differs from how they perceived it to be. We can also be seen to be engineering others' attitudes or opinions to suit our own by drawing attention to a factor that has been overlooked or ignored. You can gain appreciation by highlighting a certain issue as long as you do so sensitively, not heavy-handedly. $\", '^ Be meticulous around paperwork. This is an area many of us dislike, but a day spent clearing up all your bits and pieces and analyzing the value of premiums or costs you pay out, can help you to get abreast of what is really valuable. Somewhere amongst the pile on your desk or the clutter in a drawer, can be something which pleasantly surprises you. $', \"^ How big an issue you want to make of an issue is very much up to you. Watching you and a certain person trying to resolve an issue is a bit like watching a tennis final. It's over to you, back to them, back to you again and then shot straight back to them. This too-ing and fro-ing is not going to continue for much longer and you could  I repeat, could  be underestimating the power you hold to reach an amicable resolution. A simple 'yes' from you could bring a huge change. $\", '^ Your energy or enthusiasm levels are boosted now, and allowing others to connect with and support your ideas or proposals helps to enhance chances of success with strength in numbers involved. You could be looked to for guidance and are very well-placed to steer someone in a direction they need steering. Also, expect a generous gesture on your part to be repaid or reciprocated in a very touching way. $', \"^ You are doing an excellent job of proving someone wrong. They find this frustrating because they believed you'd have give up or gone home long ago. Yet, you're managing to hang on and defy all explanation as far as they're concerned. You're undoubtedly under unnecessary and unfair pressure from someone now. This is nearly finished  and you will win! $\", \"^ We humans are far from perfect and we know it, too. Yet, we can be our own worst critics when it comes to recognizing how we made a mistake or error of judgment. We chastise ourselves for not being more aware or 'tuned in' to something we should have seen in an obvious way. Mistakes and errors of judgment can be wonderful things, though. Without them we don't learn and grow as individuals. That's why you needn't regret or resent having made a certain mistake now. $\", \"^ A certain commitment or responsibility might be taking up much of your time, causing you to wonder how you're really benefiting from continuing to give as much as you are to it. Don't be discouraged by how much remains to be done where this is concerned. Focus instead on how much you have accomplished and achieved. By looking backward briefly, you might actually find reassurance of how able you are to invest further time and effort to whatever-it-is. $\", \"^ Millions of people enjoy playing lotteries. They do so armed with knowledge about how slim their chances are of winning huge sums of money are but the old adage 'you need to be in it to win it' spurs them on to buy their tickets in the hope that, if someone has to win, it might be them. Success you yearn for requires you to take action. It also requires you to be realistic about your chances of attaining success. Take action but have reasonable expectations now. $\", \"^ You could feel pulled in more than one direction at this time, particularly socially where you're expected to be two places at once. Your keenness to ensure nobody's disappointed is understandable but trying to placate everyone puts you at risk of pleasing everyone but yourself. Don't hesitate to say the word 'no' if you know it needs saying. $\", \"^ We don't have to look hard for distractions in any area of our world. These take many forms and one form they take is worrying. When we worry, we take our eye off a ball we should be keeping it focused upon. We also know worries have a tendency to multiply. One becomes another that becomes another and, well, you know the rest. You appear to have something requiring you to be focused on it to make it happen. Ignore worries attached to it and success is assured. $\", '^ A mid-week flutter can appeal to you. Although astrology is less to do with pure fortune than people often think, the hand of fate may just come down on your shoulder positively this week. In any case, whatever your circumstances you can have the vague sense that things can pick up and improve. Feeling lucky can in turn actually see you be lucky! $', \"^ A need could exist in an area of your world now to 'get to the point'. This might involve a demand being made of you or it might be you doing the demanding but, in any case, fact needs separating from fiction or at least that which is superfluous or irrelevant. Dancing around a particular issue or handling it with kid gloves is no longer an option. It's time to see the reality of a situation and this might require you to ask more than one awkward question but doing so will bring a helpful result. $\", \"^ Your help is needed. So too, is your input. However, you're not quite able to provide either because whoever requires both hasn't asked for it and herein lies the problem. I suspect you're aware of problems that might present themselves if you decided to intervene prematurely. Give someone a bit more time to come to you, rather than the other way around. Once they do, you'll be able to offer help or guidance that really will make a difference. $\", \"^ Hindsight. It always seems to highlight what we might have done differently with the benefit of it. It's possible you're clinging to something that has reached the end of its lifespan. You can't change the past or a previous outcome and dwelling on it is depriving you of something worthy of your focus and attention here and now. By doing what your heart urges you to do now, this can be a time you'll look back on as one where a helpful and pivotal change was made. $\", \"^ Imagine a sporting event without goalposts. Imagine as well the same event with no clock to dictate time in which goals must be scored within. There would be much activity but none of it focused properly. You appear to be in a similar situation now. Much time and energy is being given toward a plan or cause but a few things need defining. It's time to decide, once and for all, what must happen and by when. Prepare to experience much needed clarity. $\", \"^ You have, for some time, been unsure about how best to proceed with a plan that involves you having to invest considerable trust in someone else's motives. You've had no choice other than to believe what someone has been telling you and been basing your next move on how believable what you're being told is! This has caused you to feel reluctant toward involving yourself further. Expect clear evidence of why you were right to refrain from involving yourself further. $\", '^ Does it feel as if an invisible clock is ticking or everyone else has all the time in the world yet you are painfully aware of how quickly time is running out in one area of your world? In such a situation, most other people would panic. Not you, though. You know what you need to do in what little time you have. A combination of faith and focused effort will bring a reassuring reward. All you need to do to receive it is be prepared to invest both. $', \"^ Try not to assume others are completely in the picture about something you're keen to achieve and what their respective roles will be. You're likely to be more involved with steering or encouraging others' involvement than you believe necessary at this stage. You're being looked to for leadership or input. Do your best to provide both where both are needed. $\", \"^ We can all recount times when gaining something meant a compromise or sacrifice had to play a part in the plan. Your loyalty to a certain person or organization might need to become less of a priority to pursue a plan that is more appropriate for you. Somehow, somewhere, something must be lost if a gain is to be made. If what you're pursuing feels right to you, then trust that feeling, even if it means altering a connection or involvement that might have been suitable until now. $\", \"^ Perhaps, it might be appropriate to read today's forecast for Scorpio as the message from the sky to both Scorpios and Aquarians is surprisingly similar. It surrounds a need to make clear to a certain person something they have overlooked through being so focused on a belief that they are right in some way. Someone believes they're infallible where making a mistake is concerned. It is likely to be up to you to point out the fact that they might actually be wrong for a change! $\", '^ An excess of nervous tension could see you feel weary or with ambitious plans to get things done, which in one way or another, can get snared by unforeseen delays, which in turn, can cause even more frustration. You may be better off occupying yourself with non-essential things or if you can, to take the time out to read, listen to music and relax. $', \"^ They say there's no point crying over spilt milk. There's also another saying that involves taking action after a proverbial horse has bolted. Both point toward futility surrounding dwelling on the past and focusing intently on a situation after the fact. Once a situation has occurred, it always makes far more sense to focus on what can be done in the present and the future. The past has no part to play in a decision you need to make now that a very happy future is reliant upon. $\", \"^ When we feel stuck in a situation or arrangement, we can't help but think someone else is benefiting from our willingness to remain in it. Then, resentment sets in. We want freed from a restrictive situation but see no way of removing ourselves. You look set to receive helpful and timely insight into a way you can be freed from a situation or arrangement. Try not to be so fussy that you dismiss an option that, with closer examination, will reveal itself as an ideal opportunity. $\", \"^ It's time to free yourself from a certain fear or resentment. As much as you might be viewing a situation in an area of your world as less than ideal or wish there were aspects of it you could change, the sky's encouraging you to accept reasons why you should be celebrating rather than resenting a certain situation. Ignore restrictions where they exist. Look closely at how supported you are in many ways. What is right and promising needs acknowledging by you now. $\", '^ Another lucky day  they seem to be more frequent recently. If you have big plans or want to take a risk, this is the time to have a go. A social event may put you in touch with someone who has specialist knowledge and with whom you may feel drawn to start a partnership on either a business or romantic level  maybe both. Something interesting is in the air! $', '^ When a sudden, unexpected development occurs, our brains send immediate messages to our inner Worry Department and Priming Division, in order for us to be prepared in ways we might need to be. The Solution Sector is then brought in to assess and analyze best steps forward that can be taken. All of this goes on without our knowledge, initially, anyway. All such divisions only answer to you. What you say goes. So, make clear they can resume their positions and relax! $', \"^ Some people possess the ability to speak authoritatively. This makes people listen to them and people then believe those speaking must be right and knowledgeable. They must be drawing upon and sharing vast and varied experience for our benefit. In truth, these people often don't know as much as they think they do. Don't allow yourself to be influenced by a know-it-all now. $\", \"^ Sometimes when things appear to reach breaking point, it's when they improve. If there has been something of a power battle going on either at home or at work, this may be closer to a resolution than you realise. However, try not to let your stubborn side or need to be right, get too much into the equation. A little humble pie could work wonders. $\", \"^ You might feel frustrated at being unable to reveal certain plans because you know they aren't ready to be subjected to scrutiny they're likely to receive from others. This could be a theme that commences from today until 2020 as Saturn influences all that's concealed or kept secret. You don't want anyone to detect your plan that involves striking out on your own. Trust your intuition to inform you when the time is right to make your move. $\", \"^ Someone saying they'll consider what you're asking of them but on the condition a certain condition applies is not the same as someone disagreeing with you. Where you might not receive an instant answer of approval, you do look set to receive a tentative agreement in some way. This is something that can be built upon and progressed in a way that suits you and someone else. So, although an answer might not be exactly what you'd hoped, it is still a positive response! $\", \"^ A learning curve could be growing steeper in a seemingly unhelpful way but it's important you trust that you're more supported and possibly integral to a certain plan than you believe yourself to be. You appear left to your own devices in some way and are having to learn as you go along which isn't necessarily an undesirable situation to be in. It's what you're learning in your own way and time that is about to come in very handy - and will serve to impress a particular person. $\", \"^ You can't step into the ring until touched. Such is one of only a handful of rules in professional wrestling. You might be wrestling with a need to step in and intervene where it is necessary for you to watch and wait for a bit longer. As much as you might be able to offer support, guidance, insight or help in a particular way, an understood line exists that can only be crossed at a crucial point. You haven't reached that point yet. So, watch and wait until you're needed. $\", \"^ 'You can't hurry love, no, you'll just have to wait' Diana Ross and Phil Collins seemed to understand the point.

Trust as well that the cosmos doesn't intend to make you wait without providing a few very pleasant distractions either! $\", \"^ You could feel sentimental or melancholy as you find yourself reflecting upon past life experiences. There is a purpose to this walk down Memory Lane, though. You might have been certain you'd put one past situation behind you, but it might become clear how you can move on from it now. All you need to do is connect with the lesson contained within it. The sky insists it exists in there somewhere. $\", \"^ In the same way the Wizard of Oz summoned the lovable lead characters to collect their prizes, you too are being summoned, interestingly and ironically, to step forward to make a courageous move or statement. It's time to make an announcement, publicly or on a one-to-one level that could be controversial. Say what needs to be said now. Doing so will create a new process that will liberate you in some way. $\", \"^ When we wear our hearts on our sleeve or show emotion in a way that we don't normally show, it can sometimes be precisely what someone has been waiting for. If you've been adopting a philosophical or perhaps a cerebral attitude or approach to something that deserves to be felt rather than thought about, you could discover approaching it in a more emotional way is what's needed now and this will delight and reassure a particular person, too. $\", \"^ We all have much to answer for regarding things we said or did in the 'heat of the moment'. When passions run high, we sometimes can't control ourselves. Many people wish they or those they know could be in such a position! You, on the other hand, are aware now of a decision made with the absence of reasoning. That doesn't necessarily make it wrong. $\", \"^ Does gain only come from pain? Do we have to experience some level of discomfort before we can attain something we've worked hard to achieve? You have recently had your share of discomfort.

You are yet to experience your gain from your pain. The sky insists it is on its way. $\", \"^ Decisions, when they need making, tend not to hang around until we're ready to make them. A result or solution sometimes requires quick thinking. We know some decisions made in haste could have been better but we do get it right sometimes. Recently, you had to 'think fast' where a commitment or arrangement is concerned. You know a decision was made hastily and have been quietly concerned about whether or not it was correct. Expect to see evidence now that it was. $\", \"^ You might sense one or two people are becoming accustomed or perhaps a bit too comfortable with your generosity and knowing where to draw certain lines might not be easy. By focusing on your needs, you send out a message about reclaiming your own time and space. Anyone who begrudges you either or both clearly has their best interests at heart so don't allow yourself to be pressured into feeling guilty. $\", \"^ A particular restriction might be strong and tricky to ignore. You might have resigned yourself to a situation or arrangement being inflexible and difficult to alter or free yourself from. It's possible though that you've adhered too strictly to someone else's idea of what constitutes boundaries you need to work within. These might have been appropriate in the past but they're no longer appropriate now. It's time to cross a line you believed shouldn't or couldn't be crossed. $\", \"^ Is it up to you to show someone the error of their ways? They appear to be going against the grain of what you believe to be appropriate or, dare I say it, morally acceptable. How they choose to approach a certain situation is their prerogative but the quest for justice that exists within you can't help but think need exists for you to intervene in some way. Take an interest by all means, but trust that what you're seeing affects and should involve you in very measured ways. $\", \"^ You could be aware of your inability to control your feelings about a certain matter. Something brewing within you could be too strong or compelling to ignore. It's also possible a matter of principle is at stake, and that's fueling your determination to refuse to simply let the matter go. If it's justice you want to see done in a certain area, then you can trust it will happen with or without your intervention. Relax and allow a process unfolding now to continue to do so. $\", \"^ How willing are you to defend yourself? Has a need not presented itself previously whereby you had to justify your actions in some way? You appear in a situation requiring you to invest further time and effort in placating a demanding individual. You're not as obliged as you think to give them the answers they believe they're entitled to. $\", '^ Your laughter lights up today, even the start of this week. And a little frivolous distraction can interweave with your mind zipping around more serious subjects, just as brilliantly. Youll want to share any feelgood factor with anyone you come into contact with. If you work with the public, in retail, teaching, training or communications, youll be buzzing! $', \"^ 'Imagine everyone sat in the audience is stark naked'. Such words of advice are often given to amateur performers experiencing fear at performing in front of an audience for the first time. The idea behind the advice surrounds seeing those that are regarded as superior or in a strong position to judge as comical and even inferior. This is supposed to boost the confidence of the fearful performer. You, on the other hand, don't need to attempt such a thing to be seen as equal or even superior where you feel less than superior. All you need to do is be yourself. Say or do only what you know you would say or do, not anyone else. $\", '^ You can be tenacious, in a way similar to members of the previous zodiac sign to yours, of Capricorn. Thats because both signs share the stoic Saturn as your ruling planet. Yet even if you have felt you have been swimming against the tide, remember thats just the way with tides, they ebb and they flow and an ebb can now see you fight back, and how so. $', '^ You may be very tempted to get out and enjoy an evening of fun, frolics and reminiscences. Yet you are still aware that you need to recover from many months of hard work, and could just as easily retire and let the old year slip into the new while you slumber. But your friends have other plans. It looks like you are going to be thrust into a party situation, anyway. Enjoy! $', \"^ In the right light, a kitten can cast a shadow that could resemble a Bengal tiger. The kitten might even enjoy being seen in such a way and causing unnecessary and unfounded concern to anyone seeing its shadow. Once we see the reality behind what scared or intimidated us, we feel relief and even an inclination to laugh. It's important you see an issue presenting itself in an area of your world now in a similar light. Concern looks likely to be replaced by relief, soon enough. $\", \"^ How much of an expert are you on 'body language'? How adept are you at reading minds? I ask because possessing both skills would help your current situation, particularly where need exists for you guess what someone else is thinking. You're not being given as much information as you'd like about where someone else's head is at and are having to apply much guesswork. You know what risks exist through doing this. Perhaps it's time to request some answers. $\", \"^ Each of us reserves the right to be fussy. We recognize the benefits of not settling for second best. Sometimes though, our insistence upon an opportunity being perfect can cause some wonderful opportunities to pass us by. They have a tendency to not hang around indefinitely. Where in your world might you be setting too high a standard? Where might you have dismissed something or someone worthy of a second look? That's something you ought to consider now. $\", \"^ Many people are skilled in the art of persuasion. They engineer conversations to get specific results and the person they're persuading often doesn't realize how each step of the conversation is carefully planned. The sky speaks of you and someone else having such an exchange now. A more straightforward and honest discussion will bring a better and quicker result. $\", \"^ There are, and always will be, people who like the sound of their own voice. Some people say much but really say very little and it becomes apparent to those of us on the receiving end that two monologues don't always make a dialogue. A frustrating influence exists now in the form of someone who insists on talking at you instead of with you. They're not as knowledgeable or authoritative as they believe themselves to be. $\", '^ Entertainers and performers know how to do it. So too do pantomime villains. By making simple statements or gestures, huge and positive responses can be invoked from crowds of people. You could be surprised now at the level of support that comes your way through merely suggesting you need it. Help often comes from the most unexpected sources but you appear to have more help at your disposal in more ways than one than you probably realize. Ask and it can be yours. $', '^ Ever dreamed of cultivating your own vegetables, keeping chickens or living closer to nature? Well, you can find the wherewithal to put such hopes in motion now. And even if you reside in an urban environment and have limited space, it will be amazing what you can achieve with a few window boxes or grow bags. The good life appeals! $', \"^ We're discouraged from looking backward at where we've been or come from. There are good reasons why it's unhelpful to keep looking backward, especially if we're certain that's not where we're heading. However, this is a time when you might benefit from casting a casual glance backward to see for yourself how you've created momentum in some way. This is working superbly on your behalf now. If you must look back, then do so with the intention of reminding yourself how good you are! $\", '^ You may find yourself thinking about the last few days, and if they have gone well, feeling rather chuffed about it. The reason is that you have probably been able to balance the bubblier and more charismatic sides of your personality with that sensible streak you have. Feedback may have been fleeting, but you have made a mark. $', '^ The force really is with you! Believe it and the more you can capitalize on a month of rare opportunity. You can be at your charismatic best, which can draw lots of admiration your way, ideal to be daring with your image and have the confidence to be a little more glam or outrageous. Both love and loot are also looking blessed from the 14th to the 19th. $', \"^ There's a popular saying about trying to make horses drink. There's a similar saying about trying to teach pigs to sing. Sometimes, we must accept there are limits to how able we are to encourage, coerce or even cajole someone to do what we want them to do. We must also accept there are better things we could be doing with our time. Your time would be far better spent focusing on a new chapter unfolding in your world than trying to repair something best left alone. $\", '^ A legalistic matter can get heavy. If you are thinking of litigation you need to be sure of what you are doing. Think of the stress and aggravation that will be generated, as well as the potential for coming out the winner. Are you sure you have been cheated? Be clear about your motives and aware of the strength of your opponent, proceed cautiously. $', '^ A demand for attention could be a source of frustration or tension. Does a certain person need to be told to give you space? Are you obliged to respond to demands being made of you or do you not have an interest in complying with what someone expects from you? Tension or uncertainty will be brief but understand that your actions could speak far more loudly than words now. Walk the talk where possible. That way, a compromise is far more likely to be reached. $', \"^ John Lennon once said 'life is what happens when you're making other plans'. Some people see life as a fun thing, creating and seizing opportunities. They are far too busy doing interesting and exciting things to worry about mundane stuff. Your astrological climate could make you serious and concerned with matters that you needn't be so concerned about. You can afford to relax. $\", '^ Activity either side of your sign sees the Moon in Pisces forming a sextile with Mercury in Capricorn. The Moon then goes on to conjunct Neptune in Pisces. A brave idea requires a brave step to be taken and this could be connected with a goal or dream close to your heart. Ignore your rational side and be led by what might seem too fanciful. You can draw others into a unique world of images and dreams. Let whoever chooses to join you come along for the ride, too! $', '^ Your antennae are seeking vibes that tell you an interesting person is in the vicinity. Today you may find that the most fascinating person you meet is actually yourself. You are filled to the brim with exciting, unique and forward thinking ideas. Pity the rest of the world lags behind. Yet someone who totally understands can emerge. $', '^ Just because something refuses to go to plan, it doesnt mean that the plan itself is wrong. However, you might find yourself wondering today whether it is. Fortunately, the astral cavalry has appeared over the top of the hill in the guise of charming Venus. This says that if you cant fix or control everything, chill out, stand back and shrug. It will come right! $', \"^ An issue could surround inactivity or your belief that doing nothing might be better than doing something. You might be wondering if you're better off doing nothing than making effort and causing a problem you believe is keen to present itself to make an already complex situation worse. Doing nothing is not an option. Your instincts are probably making this clear. You can only benefit now from doing what you are fearful of or hesitant toward. $\", '^ If things seem out of balance around you, peoples responses seem sharper, or you feel a bit off balance, rather than thinking that this is something that is being inflicted upon you, look inside and delve into how you are reacting. Might you be a little calmer, or take things less personally? Once you are clearer, you will be able to express yourself succinctly. $', \"^ There is, in your mind, a clearly defined line regarding your involvement with a certain situation. You can see how you have something to offer and can make a difference  even if it is to provide unbiased advice or diffuse tension within it  but there appear to be ethical issues to take into account. Should you get involved? How much of what's happening is your business? Push aside the tendency to judge a situation or person now. You can help and are right to do so. $\", \"^ Let's talk about 'reverse psychology'. This involves a persuasion technique involving false advocacy of a belief or behavior contrary to the belief or behavior which is actually being advocated. You can make real and tangible progress by adopting such a technique now. This involves smiling where you would understandably do the opposite. A positive attitude will turn an otherwise negative situation around now. $\", \"^ Try, if you can, to distinguish between 'good' and 'bad' pressure in an area of your world. The former is helpful and pushing you toward a destination you've long wanted to arrive at. The latter? Well, it's doing exactly the same thing but with a different agenda. It's instilling a false sense of urgency where a plan or obligation is concerned. If you sense urgency or a need to react anxiously in any way, ignore it. Follow only the positive and gradual pressure on offer now. $\", \"^ Sometimes, we have a choice about what we become preoccupied with. Other times, we find ourselves preoccupied with issues we wish we could push to the back of our minds. The former excites us. The latter makes us fearful. That's why we struggle with ignoring it. What bothers you now is what astrologers call a 'storm in a tea cup'. Don't feel inclined to focus so intently on it. $\", \"^ If you're unhappy in a relationship, the influence of todays Neptunian influenced Full Moon can have a telling impact. But it can also make it hard to figure how you feel. With Mars surging towards the restrictive Saturn, there is even more reason to think twice before you make major decisions - especially one that sees you escaping from a current commitment. $\", \"^ Several planets are conspiring to help you. There can even be chains of events which link together positively. You're the zodiacs natural democrat, and your ability to get along with lots of different people, but without compromising your independence, is high. You are entering a truly progressive period, so dont stand timidly on the side lines, get stuck in! $\", '^ Recent weeks have seen you experience a positive transformation. Not so long ago, you felt beholden or obliged to a certain person. It appeared they had the upper hand and odds were stacked in their favor. Now, it appears a balance of power is shifting nicely your direction. This is because someone has accepted your point of view. All you need to do now is forgive and forget and you are capable of doing both. $', \"^ This could be one of those times when you feel especially keen to keep certain proverbial cards close to your chest, rather than engage in complex discussions with others about what you're thinking or feeling. Although it's likely those around you can put two and two together to connect with what's on your mind, you're not obliged to open up to anyone beyond what you feel comfortable with at this time. If others give you space to come to them when you're ready, then you know you will. $\", '^ Your feelings can be close to the surface. Yet if this brings a more emotional side of you out, this might not be a bad thing. You can particularly appreciate one person. This may not be a personal friend, as much as someone wise and progressive, someone who is helping you to see that there are other ways to approach your life. $', '^ One important person in your situation can come out as being dead set against something you plan or are involved in. For example, if you have become snared in what they see as a unsuitable romantic relationship, they may not be slow to tell you. The force of this opposition could stun you. Or are you about to show your much more rebellious side? $', \"^ What you're choosing to conceive in your mind, and believe, you look certain to achieve. That's easy enough to remember: conceive, believe, achieve. You might be intrigued by your own train of thought and how much consideration you're inclined to give it. Would you normally be reluctant to consider what is capturing your imagination? What matters is you allow a certain niggling thought to niggle you into action. It contains something you need to look more closely at. $\", '^ Good news can drop on the doormat about a job application, or one for a business start up grant. If neither is in the offing, use the sparkling alliance of Mercury and Jupiter to extend your circle of contacts. This can be a spectacular time to network or to go on a course to learn new skills. New technology, machinery or equipment can be a breeze for you. $', \"^ A particular situation can't be walked away from. As tempting as it might be to do so and as justified as you might feel through refusing to see through to completion something that has been started, you know you have an obligation to continue. You also know what you're learning about yourself through all that's happening. If you need a reason to continue, remember that. $\", \"^ It's not a good idea to put up pictures or shelves on a freshly painted wall before paint is dry. It's unwise to eat some foods before they're cooked properly. I think you get the gist of what I'm saying. Curb your impatience now to instigate something before it's time. Let a bit more time pass before making an important move or decision. Something isn't ready quite yet. $\", \"^ An 'easier' option is, of course, an option. We prefer easier options to those that require us to summon courage or justify ourselves in some way. You are being presented with an easy option where a tense or difficult situation involving you and a certain person is concerned. You are inclined to believe that a hidden problem exists with pursuing it. Take the easy option now. $\", \"^ We've spoken before about how misery loves company. Negativity has a limited lifespan on its own. It needs to be spread to welcoming hosts. That's why, in the same way you'd avoid deliberate contact with someone suffering from influenza, you avoid a visibly negative situation in your world now. It wants you to be part of it and you do not need to succumb to its demand. $\", \"^ It's easy to identify what we don't have. It's equally easy to identify what we want. Sometimes though, we need to be clear about what we genuinely don't want before we can be clear about what we want. Recent events have made clear what or who you don't want. Getting what or who you do want is going to require a strategy and that starts being formulated now. $\", '^ Information is changing your life whether it comes from books, overheard conversations, surfing the internet or from within the recesses of your own mind. Some of the concepts that you dare to entertain could blow a circuit as they are so different to the way most people think. But out of this you are hatching a cunning plan that could change your life forever. $', \"^ Most people think and dream in a language they use most. People who speak more than one language sometimes say they think and dream in more than one language. Whatever way you choose to communicate to yourself must make sense to you. Sometimes though, we don't listen to what inner voices tell us. We ignore them in the belief that what they're telling us isn't relevant at that time. It is essential you heed your inner voice now. Its message cannot be ignored. $\", \"^ If you want to fly with eagles, then don't mix with turkeys. So goes the old saying. To some extent, we're known by company we keep. An issue might be raising itself regarding those you associate yourself with only because you appear to be caught in the crossfire of strong opinions affecting you. Negativity is breeding within certain circles. Unless you have a genuine desire to become part of counterproductive discussions, keep your distance, for the time being at least. $\", \"^ If we find ourselves going round in proverbial circles where trying to solve a particular problem is concerned, then all we achieve is dizziness. We can't be moving forward if we're covering the same circle of ground. Where a repetitive cycle occurring in an area of your world, you might need to invest a tiny bit more effort than you thought you would to break a level of monotony. As long as you want a situation to move forward instead of remaining stuck, then it will. $\", '^ Are you about to go all gooey when it comes to romance - an area that you are legendary for your detachment? Umm, well, perhaps. So the swirling and sometimes confusing energies of Venus opposite Neptune may indeed help you to open up and be less hidebound. You just need to make sure that you open up to the right person Aquarius. $', \"^ We can be too suspicious of unexpected developments. Something occurs out of the blue that makes clear a plan needs to be changed in light of it and we see this change as a setback or unhelpful obstacle. Think of how some athletes will be removed from a game in order to allow another to come on. What's being removed is making it possible for what's replacing it to shine and bring a desired result. That's precisely what's happening in your world now! Welcome it. $\", \"^ Someone close or a friend might be critical of a decision made recently and instead of reacting defensively, try to take on board their point. If this has something to do with how much you're giving or supporting someone else and possibly being taken advantage of in the process, then it might be time to reevaluate the situation. Just be aware of how unintentionally barbed or aggressive your words can be now. $\", \"^ The best laid plans rarely go to plan and you're having to readjust yours now because of a situation that has presented itself suddenly. It's not that you resent having to give in to someone else's agenda as much as the fact that you don't appear to have much choice. Be flexible and you'll be glad you did. Compromise really will translate into progress if you want it. $\", \"^ We always feel a warm glow when we discover a hunch was correct. We feel an even warmer glow when we discover we were right to trust our instincts about something that confused or daunted others. Fortunately, we don't always have to blow trumpets or make a considerable effort to let others know how astute we are. Maintaining a quiet level of pride about how right you were in some way could do just as much as a brassy fanfare where drawing others' attention is concerned! $\", '^ You have some brilliant ideas, and you know a lot of people who also have them. Maybe it would help to get together with them and see what you come up with. Jupiter in Aries suggests that as a team you can work a miracle or two. In fact socializing seems to be the key to creating the levels of success you deserve. Be proactive about finding the right connections. $', \"^ An idea or plan could receive a proverbial green light and as much as you might understandably choose to seize an opportunity, consider how strong the foundations of what you're embarking upon really are. Rather than focus solely on the end goal, something needs to be commenced slowly, properly and thoroughly. Ignore anything the resembles a short cut because the sky implies you'll be deluding yourself if you think you see one. $\", \"^ Your desire to alter a certain plan might not win you popularity prizes with certain others but there's something you're able to see that they're not within it. In truth, you're about to bring a much-needed sense of pragmatism or logic to what's been allowed to become sporadic or chaotic. Have faith that your input and proposed alteration will be accepted eventually. $\", \"^ You might not be in the mood or inclined to involve yourself with anyone who brings a wave of negativity to your exchanges, and rightly so. Misery, as they say, loves company and you're not obliged to be affected by anyone's pessimistic outlook. If someone needs input or advice, then be willing to offer it, but if they intend to release all they believe is wrong with their world or the world generally, then you've got better things to do than listen. $\", \"^ You're making progress Aquarius  even if you dont feel you are. This is because there are several themes and patterns going on in your world that are edging you towards something much bigger and better. True, you need to really commit yourself, and at times, it may seem as if the pickings are slim. But step back, survey the scene, things are shaping up nicely. $\", '^ With Venus being opposed by the Full Moon in Aquarius, a lot of your preconceptions about relationships are in a state of flux, but this can be a very positive flux. Sharing may never have felt so sweet, and even if you have been trying to maintain your independence, you can find yourself more drawn than ever, to a deeper love. $', \"^ For as long as everyone has their own set of needs and priorities, these will always have to be taken into account whenever we try to get someone to do something. If they can recognize the benefits to them of co-operating, then the task is made infinitely easier. That's your task. Make the benefits to someone of what you're asking of them clear and you will make progress. $\", \"^ We have all seen impatience in animals such as dogs and cats at feeding time and as keen as fish are to emerge from hiding places to the top of a tank or fish bowl when they detect the sprinkling of food, do fish have real needs to be impatient? Impatience could get the better of you now. You don't need to believe something as urgent or demanding of your time as it appears. $\", \"^ We speak about minds being 'made up'. That's a bizarre choice of words. 'Made up'? Yet, we hear people say it every day and the statement undermines effort they've gone to in order to reach a decision. Someone needs to know you've reached a decision of some kind. A bit of imagination applied to telling them will serve to ensure the importance isn't undermined or diluted. $\", \"^ Others might be puzzled by your motives or fail to see the method in your apparent madness but they won't be able to deny how passionate you are about achieving a particular result. This might be all that's needed for you to assume a position of leadership in a collaborative effort. However, it could become clear very early on that others will be unsupportive if they sense they're being told what to do as opposed to asked. Use of the word 'we' is essential in your aims now. $\", '^ So much can happen in one day. What would you like to see happen in your special time allocation today? Might today be a day when you bring an end to a tense or uncertain drama? It could be, if you want it to be. You can let things tick along as they have been, knowing where you stand in some ways and focusing on all that has been and remains negative, or you can start to make a much needed change. The power to influence an outcome really is yours now. $', \"^ Some people talk at us, thinking their every carefully chosen word is being eagerly listened to. They believe that, for as long as we appear awake, we are receptive to all they're telling us. Someone in your world needs to understand there are limits to how willing you are to hear what they have to say. Make it clear when you've heard enough. $\", \"^ Pride and relief come from discarding items taking up valuable space that no longer play a part in assisting or furthering us. You're being encouraged to assess how your world can be improved by removing what no longer plays a part in assisting or furthering you. A fresh start is needed but resist being driven by emotion. If you can detach yourself emotionally and instigate a necessary change, then you can benefit enormously from pride and relief that will result. $\", \"^ How transparent is a certain person? You probably have your suspicions about a hidden agenda or ways in which they appear to be well-meaning. Let's give them a tiny benefit of doubt for now but I suspect something in your mind doesn't quite 'add up'. Some people can amaze with smiles that conceal hidden motives. Some are even so good at trickery that you'd swear you saw their hands the whole time. Be cautious where a certain sweetly smiling person is concerned now. $\", \"^ Turning a blind eye, the other cheek or avoiding confrontation for the sake of an easier life are admirable traits but not always sensible. You're encouraged to take a brave step forward where a particular individual or organization are concerned. A relaxed attitude might have been helpful until now but try to connect with how and why it's necessary to take a stand. Perhaps, someone needs to know you're no pushover. $\", \"^ If we feel no motivation toward doing something, it's usually because we don't see it as important. Sometimes though, we put off doing something because, for reasons known only to ourselves, we fear the task itself. There's something you cannot put off doing any longer. If you face the task that await your attention and get it done, you'll enjoy freedom that doing so brings. Where there is freedom, there is usually reassurance or relief. Prepare to feel all three. $\", \"^ We tend to be more willing as children than adults to explore 'what else might be possible' or push a boundary or two. That's because we possess fewer fears and doubts as youngsters. It could be more than helpful for you to connect with your inner child and push aside fear or doubt in a particular area. You're right to wonder what else might be possible or if a boundary is as flimsy as it appears to be! $\", \"^ Look beyond what's superficial or phony. You're not in the company of individuals who genuinely want what's best for you. The sky speaks of hidden agendas among others and if anyone can spot these, you can. Use your instincts to weed out those you can trust and those you should keep a watchful eye on. $\", \"^ The saying 'rise to a challenge' is very pictorial, isn't it? There's some lovely and strong imagery associated with 'rising' to a dare, defiance or an ultimatum. There's even something about the word 'rising' that suggests a challenge is being met willingly yet we know that even challenges that are met willingly aren't necessarily easier. A challenge is working its way toward you now. You'll recognize it when it arrives and will do the right thing by accepting it. $\", '^ With such a lot of friendly and sociable activity in your horoscope, the move of Venus into the most prominent part of your situation can further refine your public profile. This can be a real asset at work too. However, Mercury is set to glide tomorrow into a quiet sector and the combination of all this suggests that you will be active in lots of different ways and areas. $', \"^ If you're struggling to keep up with your thoughts, then you can be certain others won't make sense of them. Taking time to start at the very beginning when conveying what's on your mind might feel frustrating but will reduce the likelihood of misinterpretation. If you need others' support to make an idea become a reality, then ensure patience plays an integral part in revealing your fantastic vision of the future. $\", \"^ Imagine driving a car through a big city. And that every set of traffic lights that you reach, are switched to green. This is how your solar horoscope is today, a time when things can just naturally flow well for you. The thing to avoid is rushing to the next set of lights because you fear that they'll be red. In other words, have faith and dont try too hard Aquarius. $\", \"^ So much in life is a 'numbers game'. When we experience disappointment, we usually take it more seriously if we've focused too intently on a particular outcome. When we put too many proverbial eggs in one basket, we reduce our chances. Your current goal will require serious focus on your part but it's important you don't pin your hopes too intently one particular outcome. The current cosmic climate definitely requires us all to have back-up plans. Have one ready. $\", \"^ How happy are you with a situation that has a 'I've been here before' feel to it? You're not just experiencing dj vu, you seem to have returned to a scenario that you found yourself in previously. You are right to be wary or slightly hesitant but it is essential to understand how different things are this time. You're wiser, stronger and much better cared for in some way now. $\", \"^ We all succumb to procrastination at times. We're often willing to accept something needs doing but if we sense time is on our side in a way that means it doesn't need doing immediately, then it's natural we should choose to focus on what does need immediate attention. The sky speaks of an obligation you know you need to fulfil and you're likely aware of how time isn't on your side in a way it has been. Make whatever has been put on a back burner a priority now. $\", \"^ Familiarity, they say, breeds contempt. The word 'contempt' is a bit harsh, isn't it? Do they not mean 'predictability' or 'convenience'? Why would we feel contempt for that which is familiar? Does familiarity not provide us with a sense of comfort? Ah, there's the key word: comfort. Where there's comfort, there's often a Comfort Zone to be found. Soon, you will be released from one you've been in for too long. $\", \"^ Where action or energy is given, there's always going to be a reaction. It might not be an immediate reaction, but there will be a reaction. You appear to be wondering why something you invested time, effort, faith and possibly money into is taking as long as it is to come to fruition. The reaction part I was on about earlier is about to kick in. Just be patient for just a little while longer. $\", \"^ Turn your hand to something creative. You might want to landscape your garden, or perhaps at least give it a makeover. After all the energy you've put into sharing and promoting your ideas recently, it's time to relax and allow some of the nervous energy to be used for more practical matters such as painting and decorating or DIY in general. $\", \"^ People don't always say what they mean or mean what they say. Your intuition is capable of putting two and two together to discover what we're being told by someone else doesn't add up. You have reservations about someone's motives behind telling you what they're telling you. You might not be receiving the full story and therein lies your concern. The full story will come in time. $\", \"^ Pressure you are under now must be noticeable. It has been building over recent weeks and whilst you've managed to keep a particular person or organization at bay, they or it appear to be growing increasingly frustrated with being told they must wait in some way. Don't succumb to further pressure put on you. You are entitled to have time to think something through properly. $\", \"^ When we see certain situations as 'cut and dried' and certain, we naturally treat them in such ways. We convince ourselves 'they are what they are' and any effort on our part to see them in any other way is unhelpful or even irresponsible. Where you might be focused on a situation being as rigid as it appears, try to see what flexibility exists within it. Provided you don't dismiss it as fixed and permanent, it is possible to bend a rule in a way that suits you. $\", \"^ Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. The trouble is, we hear more opinions from others than we often prefer to. Some people can't help but insist upon sharing beliefs or trains of thought with us in the hope we will support them or be in awe of how astute they are. Where someone in your world feels a strong need to push an opinion or belief upon you, you have the right to refuse or reject it, regardless of how persuasive or demanding they might be. $\", \"^ One of many interesting things about opportunities is, they often appear at the end of cycles. It's usually when we feel we have no options or been backed into a corner in some way that we fail to see the opportunity waiting in the wings in the hope we seize it with both hands. Don't focus on what's seemingly negative in a situation now. Look closely at why you ought to be hopeful. A certain situation is far from resolved but it's important to see how helpful that is now. $\", \"^ In weighing up the upside and potential downside to a particular situation, you could be seeing little more than a seesaw effect. One outweighs the other at one point and then the equilibrium shifts to create a very different picture. If you want the cons to outweigh the pros, then it's only a matter of time before they do. But is it not sensible to focus on what you do stand to gain from taking what appears to be a very small risk? Do so and the plus points will soon increase. $\", \"^ This is an ideal time for you to connect with and embrace your ability to welcome change. Where others might resist or resent it, you understand precisely how to instigate and harness it. It would be worth looking at an area of your world that you are keen to change or improve and this might take the form of restructuring what has become too predictable or traditional. Try to connect with excitement on offer from getting rid of what's 'old' and ushering in something new. $\", \"^ On the face of it, a situation appears cut, dried and transparent. You have every reason to believe you know where you stand with it and what is or isn't likely to change about it. Might you be a bit complacent in some way though? Have you perhaps drawn an incorrect conclusion or seen a situation as final when there's actually considerable life left within it? Expect soon to be relieved and reassured about the revival of something you'd given up hope of ever coming to fruition. $\", '^ There is a larger than life vibe bubbling away in the heavens and before the week is out, you may very well benefit from this Aquarius. But something can happen today that is much less obvious, at least that is how it may seem, because a hint, a nod or an understated sense of connection with someone can have huge importance - given time. $', \"^ We all recall how, as children, we spent hours trying to memorize something to be regurgitated the next day at school and awoke the next morning to find we could recite it flawlessly. Our subconscious can be extremely helpful sometimes and an answer to something you've pondered for some time is about to become clear. It hasn't just 'appeared'. You've made it happen and can be reassured it is the answer you need. $\", \"^ A friend you haven't heard from in ages can get in touch, you may even meet up. It can be great to catch up on the gossip. An invitation that you never thought was coming, can also emerge, but this may leave you in a quandary if you have already made plans for that day or night. It may take some considerable powers of diplomacy to sort this, but you can. $\", '^ Think the impossible, dream the dream. If you feel totally hamstrung by everyday matters, now is a superb chance to change the setting, to move the moment. But Aquarius, this will require a huge leap of faith. So, dont focus on what might go wrong but on what can go really well. Even trying for a big goal will prove satisfying. The excitement can be intoxicating. $', \"^ When setting expectations, it's always a good idea to aim a bit higher than what we want or need. This ensures a worst case scenario means we end up achieving what we wanted and where we ideally wanted to be. Bear this in mind now with an expectation you're setting. It's fine for it to be inflated but make sure it's inflated for the right reason and realistically. You could be getting carried away with a particular notion and excitement could lead to over-optimism now. $\", \"^ Sometimes, it suits us to believe a situation is complicated. If we see it in such a way, we believe it needs more respect than it deserves. We also see ourselves as inferior and create reasons why we can delay taking action or making decisions because, after all, what we're dealing with isn't straightforward  or so we believe. A seemingly complex situation or arrangement can be made remarkably easier if you're willing to ensure honesty and sincerity play bigger parts in resolving it. $\", '^ Sometimes, we believe timing must be absolutely perfect before we instigate certain discussions. We know what needs to be said but manage to identify various factors that lead us to believe we must choose our moment to raise a particular topic carefully. With Mercury influencing your relationships and commitments, an ideal moment to convey yourself to a certain person is on offer. Seize the chance. Timing-wise, this could be as good as it gets. $', \"^ The needs of others or possibly one person in particular could be dictating what needs prioritizing in your world and assisting or supporting others could be demanding much of your time and focus. As much as you might wish you had a chance to do something for yourself, trust that being there for anyone who needs you to be there for them won't go unnoticed or unappreciated. A small amount of effort on your part could make a huge difference to someone else's world. $\", \"^ Companies that call people at home always demand immediate responses to whatever they're selling. They claim they can sort out all that's necessary to make you a customer while you wait. Any sensible person won't commit without seeing evidence of its authenticity first. Don't commit yourself to anything or anyone that your instincts tell you aren't all they claim to be! $\", \"^ Precedents form a large part of our expectations. We usually have a good idea where we stand with films that have certain actors in them or books written by certain authors. Your expectations could be leading you astray now though. As much as you believe you know all there is to a situation, you need to leave a bit of room to be surprised. There is more potential to something than you're giving it credit for. $\", '^ Home comforts can attract you. Inside, this can see you call a painter, decorator or builder to ask about the feasibility and cost of any classy improvements. You may even head off to your local garden centre, keen to add some kind of lovely feature to your outdoor space, from lovely ceramic pots to funky new furniture, ready for the barbecue season. $', \"^ Many people do a convincing job of reading others' minds. However, we rarely need to apply psychic powers to know what someone's thinking or feeling. Even the most guarded or secretive person can be unaware of how much they reveal through their actions. Someone you know might be more transparent than they realize. The way they're not disguising thoughts or feelings is about to prove helpful for both you and them. $\", \"^ Waiting rooms around the world often have a stack of magazines to read in order to help pass the time. Usually, there are the sort of magazines none of us would ever read normally but, through boredom, we will pick one up and flick through pages in the hope we will find at least one interesting article. In a similar way, you have, for some time, had to 'make do' with what has been little more than a way to pass time. You've made the most of a tedious situation. That is now starting to change. Your focus is gradually being shifted to what truly matters. Prepare to feel reinvigorated. $\", '^ You have been evolving something over the last year, it just may not have been going quite as quickly as youd like. And it is important that you continue with your steady progress, because there may be some good reasons why this has not rocketed forwards. Do consider that your scheme is likely to be more enduring, because of your considered approach. $', \"^ It's easy to overlook time consuming and difficult processes involved to make something beautiful. That's often what makes something like diamonds or pearls so valuable. They'd be less valuable if someone didn't have to invest time, effort and expertise to beautify them. With that in mind, don't resent a time consuming and frustrating process in your world. Something delightful and very much worth having lies at the end of it as you'll discover soon. $\", \"^ A challenge might urge you to rise to it but, like many challenges, you might be waiting for the right time to do so or prefer to assess it from umpteen angles first. The sky speaks of you possibly feeling a bit out of your depth or aware of a potentially steep learning curve attached to what you're expected to accomplish. However, does that not make the challenge even more interesting? This could be a time for action, not in-depth assessment. $\", '^ Unfortunately, not everyone is fair and honest in their dealings. If you feel you can trust someone you are working with, it will give you the confidence to make a difference. If you dont quite know where you stand, it will undermine your morale. Yet the more you try to drive facts into the open, the more someone may seem closed or evasive, but do persevere. $', \"^ Think about adrenaline surges surfers experience when they manage to catch a particular wave or skydivers experience falling from the sky at 120 miles per hour. There are many more experiences that cause us to feel unparalleled excitement  or make our hearts beat faster. You'll soon feel your share of excitement and be very aware of how much faster your heart is beating through what can only be described as a heartwarming and very memorable experience. $\", \"^ If you're someone who always seems to find themselves looking after everyone elses needs, this can be a super point to be more in touch with your own. However, equally, if you tend to be a little bit remote, perhaps there are some barricades that need to come down. You can gain a lot by being less fearful of intimacy, closeness and loving. $\", '^ If you are someone who can be timid when it comes to your love life, finding the concept of friendship far more comfortable than full-on intense passion, you may surprise yourself today, with some heartfelt utterances. Sending a loving text message or email can truly lift your heart. Equally, you can be more assertive in seeing off a rival. $', \"^ We can all recall times when we tried to remove a small stain on clothing and succeeded only in making it bigger and worse. We inadvertently ended up making something small become a bigger and more complex problem. Similarly, a certain minor issue in your world is at risk of becoming one you'll wish you'd left well alone if you give the levels of effort you appear keen to give it. Start off slowly and sensibly! $\", \"^ Gardeners know you cannot simply pull weeds from soil and believe a weed problem is solved. Weeds have a tendency to return if roots remain embedded in soil and unless the problem is tackled at root level, it will be a constant struggle to maintain control. An issue in your world is being addressed at ground level when the problem lies deeper. Unless you're willing to do some digging and remove it properly, it will continue to rear its head indefinitely. $\", '^ Dont try too hard to impress someone new you meet. If you have recently met a partner and get introduced to his or her parents, this is precisely where you should not try to be what you think theyd like of you. Nor try to shock and awe with your more rebellious streak. Handle this weekend right and some influential contacts can emerge for you. $', \"^ People who possess considerable charm often find others very obliging toward them. We like charming people who bring joy and laughter to our worlds. The interesting thing about charm though is, it has a finite shelf life. Regardless of how charming anyone is, limits exist in terms of how far it will get them in some situations. You've tried charm in a certain area. That has likely served a purpose to a point. It's now time to apply honesty where honesty is needed. $\", \"^ Many of us have purchased flat-packed items and discovered, to our frustration, they came with instructions in foreign languages. This left us with a choice surrounding using whatever pictures appeared on the instructions or to throw the instructions away and use our intellect and instincts. Don't rely on guidance or instruction from elsewhere. Trust what you're capable of doing. $\", \"^ Many people are happy with one-sided arrangements or relationships. They suit them because they know where they stand within them. If someone believes their role is to placate or be subservient in some way to another and understanding of this exists on both sides, then there are usually few problems attached. You, however, appear to have a different idea about how an arrangement or relationship should be conducted. The sky isn't encouraging you to be selfish or unhelpful but it is encouraging you to take a stand in some way. With sensitivity, a new arrangement can be reached. $\", \"^ Ignorance, they say, is bliss. That statement is arguable. None of us wants to know we're kidding ourselves. When we are aware that we're doing so or looking at a situation with rose tinted glasses, we tend to snap out of it before long, even if the awakening process isn't particularly pleasant. Somewhere in your world, you're doubtful about a situation or arrangement. Trust that it is better right now to apply some level of caution than it is to enter blindly into an agreement. $\", '^ The Full Moon opposes your sign, but the strident and impatient Mars also stirs the brew. Your ruling planet of Uranus can see even the most even-tempered of Water Carriers be erratic and this influence may bring precisely this type of energy to the surface. A romantic relationship can see a clash or a mad attraction, but do resist controlling a partner. $', \"^ Your individuality is something others appreciate and respect. It could also attract the right kind of attention for you at this time, and it's by sending out an approachable vibe that puts you in a superb position to share experience-based wisdom. People will find your authenticity refreshing, and as far as you're concerned, you're simply 'being you.' The world needs more people like you so step forward confidently. $\", \"^ You might believe you're right to question how you arrived at a particular juncture of your life or what efforts you made to have taken you to a destination you believe you had no intention  of arriving at. Push all that aside for now. You are where you are because you're needed there. What needs to happen now is a continuation of a learning curve you commenced some time ago. As it recommences, expect to become wiser, stronger and more comfortable with where you are! $\", '^ One of your best qualities apart from sizzling good looks, kind heart and humanitarianism, is your great sense of fun. Your mischief is often of the quirky variety, even amongst others who are funny. Let this side of you flourish from now. Famous Aquarian jokers? Eddy Izzard and John Belushi are two examples, one from each side of the Atlantic. $', \"^ If I suggested we walk barefoot together through poison ivy or stinging nettles, I think I know how you'd react. You'd be unwilling to do something so daft. There can be no benefit attached to doing so. Of course, I was just testing you  in the same way someone else is testing you now. Someone's suggestion or proposal appears genuine but common sense dictates there's something essential they've overlooked. You'll see through it and pass with flying colors. $\", '^ Now, if told you to head down the gym because if you do you will soon fall head over heels in love, rightfully you might think this was a bit fatuousbut, you might be surprised where the flame of love can burst into life now. And funnily enough it can be by getting trim, doing your shopping or through work that a sultry connection can be made. $', \"^ It could be a case of 'once bitten, twice shy' where your continued involvement or support of a plan or cause is concerned. You might have received little recognition or gratitude for time and effort invested to help a person or possibly an organization. However, pressure for you to continue offering both could grow stronger. Little will have changed the second time. $\", \"^ We spoke yesterday about the benefits of giving the benefit of doubt. We're usually discouraged from being doubtful yet know giving someone the benefit of our doubt can, at times, transform an opinion or attitude in a wonderful way. Where you are being encouraged now to let a few more facts come to light or a development to unfold further, you stand to gain something very helpful and valuable. Prepare to learn something you wouldn't have learned otherwise. $\", \"^ With hindsight, you might look upon a recent decision and believe it should have been made differently. Such is the way of life and the reason why we're blessed with hindsight! It allows us to look back at situations with a different perspective and learn from choices and experiences. Don't believe you've made an error of judgment. Proof is imminent that you made a right decision. $\", \"^ None of us needs to possess Albert Einstein's level of intelligence to know that doing the same thing repetitively and hoping to get a different result is an almost dictionary definition of madness. The message from the sky to you now surrounds accepting that change needs to be introduced to a tedious and tired area of your world. It's time to try a different and more promising approach. $\", \"^ Sometimes, to gain something, we must let something go. We are naturally reluctant to let go of what's familiar to us or we believe helps to put us in an advantageous position. We forget though, that nature abhors vacuums. Where a gap gets created, it becomes filled before long. That's why you needn't be concerned about what you're having to let go of now. You're not losing anything. In fact, by creating a gap in some way, you're about to gain something of immense value. $\", '^ Over the next few days the Moon and the connections it makes to other planets can have some real impact upon your situation. You could find yourself going back and forth from being happy to do your own thing to being happy to join in. Your peers can be important, however, dont feel you cant say no and go your own way. Genuine friends will understand. $', \"^ Franklin Roosevelt said 'we've nothing to fear but fear itself'. With little effort though, each of us is capable of identifying things other than fear to be afraid of. Fear, however, is holding you back in some way now. Something you're afraid of is preventing you for attaining something very special. Do what you fear most and your fear will truly fade away. $\", '^ The zanier influence in your personality comes from the zapped up powers of Uranus. With astrology being all about timing, its angle today with the feisty Mars, suggests that one of your off-the-wall ideas, which has so far met with blank stares, can now become the vogue. So, rather than conforming to what you think others expect of you, be authentically yourself. $', \"^ Many organizations operate 'blame cultures'. 'This' happened because of 'him' or 'her' and conversations often revolve around who is going to 'pay' to 'put things right'. Whilst knowing the Finger of Blame could be pointed their direction at any time keeps someone on their toes, it doesn't stop them from being defensive or even confrontational when it happens. To reduce tension in your world, resist attributing blame in some way. Just focus on the solution. $\", \"^ Where are you encountering obstacles? Are they being put in your way by unseen forces as a joke? Perhaps you believe the cosmos is enjoying watching you struggle. The fact is, obstacles you are encountering are not being placed in your way to delay progress within a key area. They exist because they are intended to help you to stop, think and assess a situation in ways you might not have done otherwise and this, you can trust, is something you'll be grateful for. $\", \"^ Events over recent months have done much to change your focus and, without putting too fine a point on it, your 'desires' in life. With much focus having been aimed at changing aspects of your home, family or career, you probably sense that the process of change doesn't intend to give up quite yet. There is something, or possibly someone, you've outgrown. If you're not already aware of this, coming developments will kick start a new thinking process that will make it clear. $\", \"^ What would you like to see change? Perhaps, you don't crave change in any way. Maybe you're happy with the way things are in various areas of your world and don't want to instigate change for the sake of it. But, let's suppose there is something you want to change. Let's also assume you feel a particular situation is unlikely to change and you've grown used to that being the case. There is something you can change now, if you wish to do so. It's definitely worth considering. $\", \"^ it might be increasingly clear how support, advice or encouragement are being asked for from you and you'd have no hesitancy in offering any of the above if you were more reassured than you are that you won't be a perpetual problem-solver. If you feel at least one person in your world ought to be taking more responsibility for their actions, then now's a good time to speak up, lest they continue to believe you'll always be there to bail them out. $\", \"^ Our world is full of people who claim to be experts on pretty much any topic under the sun, but upon closer examination, we can discover that many of these so-called experts are a bit like the Wizard in The Wizard of Oz. They project a strong persona that conceals doubts, fears or anxieties. We tend to have more respect for someone who holds their hand up and says they don't have an answer or solution. If you sense that somebody isn't as knowledgeable about something as they claim to be, then you can gain more by saying nothing and keeping the upper hand. $\", \"^ We tend to not want chaos or uncertainty in our lives. Yet, we also know both can be by-products of having taken a risk that excites and inspires us. That's something you might need to find balance between now. Do you 'play it safe' and refuse to take a risk or might it actually be worth taking, even if does bring a brief period of chaos, uncertainty or upheaval? The choice is yours to make but if you truly want to bring progress to a certain area, then the answer is a clear one. $\", \"^ A new level of understanding in a particular area can remove stress or uncertainty. Where you might have felt you must defend yourself or a viewpoint, you could discover more benefits exist from caring a little bit less about it. This can free you from a worry or concern and, at the same time, be powerfully liberating. All that's needed is a new mindset to an old problem. $\", \"^ 'Be who you are and say what you feel. Those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind'. Dr Seuss was better known for his classic and inane children's' stories than he was for profound quotes but his words are relevant to you now. The sky speaks of a particular front or faade you're keen to adopt, perhaps believing it is in someone else's best interests that you do so. Be yourself. Speak your mind. You'll soon discover they'll respect you more for doing so. $\", \"^ Some enjoy inviting chaos into their world. When a result isn't forthcoming as immediately as they wish, they opt to tackle a self-created problem than do nothing, believing anything happening is better than nothing. Such people then wonder why life has suddenly become noticeably complex! Had they left something alone, then a positive development might well have ensued. Where you might be aware of patience levels depleting, don't succumb to a belief that stirring a bit of chaos might be what's needed to accelerate a certain process! $\", \"^ Think about the basics. Such as? Yes, well, that you've enough loo rolls in, the bills are paid and that a certain amount of order rather than chaos reigns in your life structure. If you are usually right on top of these things and pride yourself on it, you may like to think more of diet, and health and fitness. Your discipline is up, so make this work for you. $\", \"^ We all reserve the right to change our minds. It's more widely accepted than we're led to believe that we are entitled to recognize how our needs change and what we believed to be suitable or appropriate is sometimes no longer so. It also works the other way around. You have the right to pursue a plan of action you probably vowed you'd never pursue. That was then, this is now. By doing so, you are addressing your most important need. $\", \"^ As much as you might wish something was going 'your way' or you had more influence over a certain situation, accept that you have much to be optimistic about and grateful for. You might see only obstacles but might also underestimate the support you have from others who share your vision in some way. A collaborative effort might be in early stages of getting underway, but it can help you overcome a frustrating restriction that has hampered your progress so far. $\", \"^ Something is shifting where your material world is concerned and the fact that there appears to be more month left than money in your bank account probably isn't helping matters. To feel reassured, you need to have an uncomfortable conversation with a certain person who can allay many of your concerns about your future security. Once you get the facts from them, you will be in a stronger position to put certain plans in place. $\", \"^ Are you anticipating a solution to a complex arrangement that has been extremely tiring? Ok, if that's what you want, then I can give you the best possible advice for not only the aforementioned scenario but a few others as well: do nothing! You read that correctly. The best possible strategy you can adopt now is to let situations carry on with no input or intervention from you. Soon, you'll know how to react but for now, remain detached. $\", \"^ We visit people specializing in certain professions because they possess knowledge to help us. We know what our ailment, problem or issue is. We have some idea what the solution might be as well but accept there are limits to what we know or can solve on our own. You're in a similar situation with a caring cosmos now. You know what you want to see improve and why. Let it provide helpful insight into the best way to achieve this. $\", \"^ If you're unaware of how you might be spreading your time and effort too thinly to keep numerous plates spinning, then it could become apparent that something has to 'give.' This might involve brutal honesty applied to deciding what matters most and where your efforts are most sensibly and practically focused. If one plan must be shelved temporarily, then that might be a sensible first step. $\", '^ Do you have an argumentative streak? Even if you dont tend to raise your voice, you dont like to be bossed around, and your personal space is important to you. Yet someone immediately around you might be out of touch with your sensitivities. Their moods can have a big impact on your sense of happiness. Or you can find yourself acting as a peacemaker. $', \"^ 'If anything can go wrong, then it will'. So goes the famous saying about Murphy's Law. When we believe anything can and will go 'wrong', then we practically take a fire hose to any flames of enthusiasm that deserves to be given attention instead and risk causing a negative outcome. You really can afford to cease priming yourself for something to go 'wrong' now. $\", \"^ We hear people speak of 'hidden agendas'. We don't hear the phrase 'conflicting agendas' as often despite encountering them more frequently than hidden agendas. We all reserve the right to be passionate and invest utter belief in what matters to us. When two people do this, there is often a clash of some sort as two people will not agree on everything all of the time. That's why you need to be a bit more supportive and flexible where someone's conflicting agenda is concerned. $\", '^ Do you feel as if your hands are tied? Are you experiencing a noticeable sense of restriction where you wish you had more freedom? You are in a situation that is frustrating you because of your perceived inability to do more to help in some way. As keen as you are to be more involved, trust that whatever or whoever it is can manage on its or their own. Focus instead on what help you could use in more than one area right now! $', \"^ We can sometimes believe some things in life don't need assessing, analyzing or dissecting because doing any so removes any mystery attached, and there can be something intriguing and fascinating about mysteries. That's why you can benefit from leaving a certain situation  or possibly an inexplicable feeling  alone. It doesn't need to make sense. Neither does it require rationalizing. Let whatever is arousing your curiosity to become less enigmatic in its own way and time. $\", '^ If you feel that you have been putting loads of effort in, take comfort from the fact that you can now start to see some tangible rewards. Yet just before these start to emerge, if you have really invested of yourself emotionally and creatively, you could feel weary, and even crestfallen. If so, try to do something nurturing, something for you. $', \"^ We hear the phrase 'be careful what you wish for because you might get it'. To anyone painfully aware of what's missing in their world, such a statement is music to their ears. Who cares what repercussions might be if we're offered something we believe we truly want and need? You care, that's who. Be honest about how relevant what you're being granted now is to your current needs. $\", '^ With Venus continuing to rewind, you could be forgiven for wondering if someones promises linked to work or a contract will ever come to pass. But the mist begins to clear today, not so much directly affecting this planet, but now you realize that its what you do that really matters. So, rather than waiting for that situation to be resolved, supercharge other options. $', \"^ Does someone else have the upper hand? Are they in a seemingly stronger position than you to dictate how a certain situation is going to be from now on? It might appear they are in a stronger position but sometimes, people who speak loudest don't always know what they're talking about. Don't feel beholden or subservient just because someone appears intimidating or inclined to dictate to you how things are 'going to be'. There is scope to strike a power balance now. $\", \"^ When all around us is chaotic or confusing, we are naturally suspicious of a delightful feeling making its presence felt. We question its timing or wonder how on Earth we're supposed to embrace it when we have so much else demanding attention. We overlook though how feelings of joy or delight are always present whenever we feel distracted otherwise. The cosmos is encouraging you to focus on what you have to be very happy with in some way. Ignore all else. $\", \"^ As tempted as you might be to step in and solve someone else's problem or offer a solution you feel they might not arrive at on their own, try to connect with the part of you that sees the benefits in letting them learn something themselves. That's not to say your input or assistance won't prove helpful later but it will be better for both of you if a certain person manages to grasp a concept or experience enlightenment in their own way. Give them a bit of time and space to do so. $\", \"^ The cosmos is preparing to give you some necessary breathing space where it's needed. You're about to be given a perfect opportunity to assess a plan or review a particular strategy. Whilst this shouldn't be seen as a chance to take your foot off the pedal, it should be seen as an opportunity to assess what feels right where a plan close to your heart is concerned and where your effort and attention are best applied. I'll have more to say about this tomorrow. $\", '^ Although Venus in Aquarius and Jupiter in Aries have been casting some magic over your situation this week, the arrival of the buzzy, breezy and bubbly influence of Mercury into the zippiest part of your situation can up the potential tenfold. Fortunately for you, this is not just for today either, but for the next eleven or so weeks. Hold on for the ride! $', \"^ It appears a certain person knows how to get a certain reaction from you. You might be of the opinion that you should hear what they have to say and why they feel you're obliged to hear it, too. Look closely at why you might feel so beholden to them and willing to consider what they feel you need to hear. You might even detect fear as being at the root of their insistence to engage you in this exchange. Make identifying what it is they're afraid of your priority now. $\", \"^ Seeing a situation or possibly an arrangement in a 'black or white' way might help you to distinguish between what's real and solid and what's on shaky ground or uncertain. It's that little 'grey area' in the middle that could be a source of confusion or frustration now. Try to recognize how stubbornness on your part to see a scenario as only one way or another could actually be the cause of an issue. Be willing to consider what you're so determined to reject or ignore. $\", '^ You can be a straight forward person, but that doesnt mean that everybody has to conform to your view of life. And yet today, someones attitude can prove disappointing. This can be made worse, simply because you dont expect it. But then perhaps you will make a stand on what seems like a trivial matter to someone else. The principle is the key. $', \"^ It's easier to agree than disagree. People like it when we agree. It means they don't have to invest precious energy trying to convince us of something. They also like it when we agree with them because it creates a perceived balance or preferred imbalance in our relationship with them. Someone wants you to agree with them and not pursue a certain matter. You appear to be struggling with this. A way exists for you to speak your mind and gain in some way now. $\", \"^ We all wish, at times, we could go back in time and change a situation from our past. We wish we could have access to a certain DeLorean and return to and alter a situation from the past in a way that ensures a better outcome in the future. Disbenefits of doing such a thing couldn't have been made clearer in the 'Back to the Future' films. Instead of wishing you could go back in time to alter an aspect of your past, focus on what you can change in some way now, because you can. $\", \"^ All too often, we spend ages, possibly lifetimes trying to find something that is available to us. We overlook the obvious in the belief that we would have spotted what we want or need if it really was in front of us. You have an opportunity now to solve one of your greatest problems by making use of something you already have available to you. You needn't look elsewhere. $\", \"^ Some salespeople can make sales by planting 'buying seeds' in the mind of potential buyers, convincing them their search for whatever-it-is is over. This works even better when a buyer believes the idea to buy something was entirely theirs. Other salespeople adopt 'hard sell' approaches, believing that, if you bully people into buying, they'll buy. Resist a belief that a 'hard sell' approach might be effective in an area of your world now. A much calmer and sensitive method really will work best and produce a much better result. $\", \"^ Inspiration is always available and tends to hope we find it rather than it coming to us. Feeling demotivated or unenthused can cause us to struggle to find necessary levels of effort to uncover inspiration's 'hiding place.' Where you might feel a situation has become stagnant or lacking any incentive, the cosmos is keen to intervene. This is a time when inspiration can be found with a willingness on your part to find it. $\", '^ You may be discovering sides of yourself that up until now have remained hidden  especially around your most intimate needs. This can see you driven to meet these. If you are solo, this may create quite a lot of action in your sex life, but whether this will lead to a longer term tie remains to be seen. Involved? Try not to be too demanding. $', \"^ Respect. Admiration. To gain both, we sometimes need to make some effort to command or demand them. We shouldn't simply assume both will automatically be forthcoming because we feel we deserve them and where you might have felt you were at risk of losing both through adopting a stubborn stance or feeling it necessary to withhold a certain principle, you could find you have more supporters than you thought you did. $\", '^ You have had many insights into the nature of things, and there are many more to come. They are all helping you to see life and your current circumstances in a new way, one in which you are free to switch realities and create to your hearts content. You no longer need to remain stuck, you can bring change into your life and let go of limitation and fears. $', \"^ It might be clear how you and a certain person are starting to reach agreement in some way but common ground needs to be found in another. Where you are in agreement, a matter appears straightforward but it's what's not being discussed or left to assumption that could prove problematic shortly if not already. Be willing to discuss openly what your expectations of someone else are  and allow them to confirm what they're expecting from you, too. $\", '^ A gift is being offered to you now. You, however, might not see it as a gift to begin with because it is cleverly concealed within an obstacle or challenge. What might make you feel inclined to roll your eyes and certain you could do without having to tackle contains something that, upon closer examination, you look likely to be appreciative of. So, roll up your sleeves and look closely. $', \"^ Here they are. Take the reins. Now you have control over something that someone else has had control of. So, now that we've established that, what do you intend to do that someone else has not done? Ah, therein lies your current problem. Perhaps you're able to see why someone else struggled to make something happen. Between the two of you, you can make it happen together. $\", \"^ Songwriters often rhyme the word 'fire' with 'desire'. There are numerous other words that rhyme with each but few words create imagery in the same way as using those particular words. They're corny and clichd but they work well together. You might be trying too hard to find the right words now to convey a point. Stick with the tried and tested. What you know works is better than trying to be too clever. $\", '^ You may be friendly with two different people, who are unknown to one another and yet you can facilitate a meeting, one which helps both these people out and potentially yourself too, into the bargain. If you enjoy researching history or your family tree, some pleasing discoveries can be made. Your curiosity really can be quite strong today. $', \"^ 'If someone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also'. Ok. We get the gist of what this Biblical quote is trying to tell us about love and understanding but who really feels inclined to deal with what is clearly a tense situation in such a way? For you to make progress now and likely involving a certain volatile person, you need to gain respect in their eyes. This can be easily done by showing understanding. Be willing to share a problem and you'll soon halve it. $\", \"^ If something appears too good to be true, then you're wise to treat it with a pinch of proverbial salt. The same can be said for a task that you believe will be a doddle to accomplish. Something could require considerably more time and effort than you might believe it will so don't convince yourself it will be achieved in record time. Focus on taking small but effective steps, even if the urge to run intensifies. $\", \"^ Because your co-ruler is the erratic Uranus, you can be a bit up and down in your thoughts and moods. But this planet also blesses you with your streak of originality. Today however, it can be the switchback side of your nature which features. However, the one thing no-one can say about you Aquarius is that you're dull! Frustrating? Well, perhaps a little! $\", \"^ A kind or generous gesture on your part will be appreciated greatly by a certain person. Your actions might take them by surprise but you'll be aware of a deeper motive that exists and how your gesture or action is as much logical as it is altruistic. In any case, making someone happy will boost your feel-good factor enormously. $\", \"^ It might become clear how you've told yourself something enough times that you started to believe it, especially where a certain aspiration is concerned. Are you pursuing it for yourself or because it satisfies someone else for you to do so? You're being encouraged now to prioritize and separate what you're doing for yourself and what you might be doing only to placate others. A revelation might be long overdue but at least it has arrived. $\", \"^ More than ever your finances are influenced by the way you think about them, and even more by how you feel about them. The move of Neptune into your money zone means that if you have a positive and upbeat approach to being better off you'll develop an unshakeable faith in yourself and then exceed your own expectations. It is a state of mind. $\", \"^ If you're convinced a certain result must happen instantly, then patience will probably be the last thing you'll be keen to summon. However, part of you can hopefully connect with the fact that the positive change you want to bring must be allowed a reasonable and practical timeframe to unfold within. Trust that you have momentum is working in your favor. Work with it rather than against it. $\", '^ Your ideas zone is absolutely bursting with vibrancy, and yet strangely, at a more emotional level, you could feel slightly disengaged. Be sure in this excitement that you are not rushing in too much. It can be a very bright week, but equally, dont let your enthusiasm run away from you too much. You may blurt something out thats best left unsaid. $', '^ Getting together with people is of course one of the themes of this time of year, but this can hold particular resonance for you. You may find yourself pushed to the front by others, a kind of unelected leader! This can be flattering, but people know that you are great at keeping everyone in the loop. Membership of any kind of club or network can be richly rewarding. $', \"^ Try not to dwell too much on whether doing something right is the same as doing it fairly. Even if you're in no doubt about this, you could focus on whether a certain arrangement is balanced in a way you'd like it to be. Doing what's fair might require you to focus more on someone else's needs briefly. You can trust you'll be doing the right thing by doing so. $\", '^ When planets rewind, as Venus does now, this can be seen as being more negative, but they also provide a chance to track back over old issues, and resolve them. Currently your freedom is at stake, however, you cannot entirely suit yourself, and in a professional situation, you may need to be aware of this. However, someone important may at last hear you out. $', \"^ A situation needs to be seen as if it is packaged and marked with the words 'fragile' or 'handle with care.' As keen as you might be to state your case or push a point of view strongly, be aware of how the situation isn't as one-sided or 'in your favor' as you might believe it is. A point does need to be conveyed, and yours appears valid. However, it doesn't need as much of a push as you might be determined to give it. Just give it a gentle nudge and let someone else fill in the gaps. $\", \"^ As children, we're encouraged to ask questions. Children are also told they should be seen and not heard. How is any child supposed to make sense of such a contradiction? Through a desire to find out more about something, you're encountering resistance from someone else who believes you only need to know something on a need-to-know basis! Don't be concerned that something is being hidden from you. You will discover what you need to know soon enough. $\", \"^ The tiniest, most seemingly insignificant development can sometimes set off the most amazing chain of events. History is full of amazing discoveries that began as nothing more than off-the-cuff comments or observations. It's important that you pay attention to the detail within something now. If you're willing to delve a bit deeper to see the bigger picture where something is concerned, then a truly wonderful discovery is assured. $\", '^ Many an Aquarian is an arm chair or bar psychologist. And though others can sometimes scorn some of the connections and observations you make about people, very often you are eventually proven to be right. There can be an essence of this today, but equally with the Moon squaring your Sun, check you dont have your own, more subjective agenda. $', '^ When anything is removed from our world, we miss it. We become aware of absence and a void that was once filled with something we were familiar or comfortable with. Anyone who has kicked a habit or decided something no longer played a part in their world knows how, eventually, we cease to miss it. The sky is offering insight into how dependent you became on something that was habitual and why you should feel optimistic, not resentful about its removal. $', '^ Stuff, and I mean that of the deeply rooted psychological variety, can bubble to the surface like never before. This could help you to create a new understanding of your deepest needs or may see you seeking counselling or wise counsel! Also, you could feel that someone is holding something important back, refusing to keep you in the loop. $', \"^ Many people spend considerable time looking at what others own or have available. This isn't always done out of jealousy, it is sometimes done in an inspiring way. Sometimes, it helps to know what someone else has attained or achieved because it proves it can be done or is available. If your reasons for comparing yourself to someone else are genuine, then expect no problems. Make sure your reasons really are positive and motivational. $\", \"^ Somewhere in your world, something is taking absolute priority over anything else. The sky doesn't suggest this has reached obsessive stages yet but you're not far off. Something does matter but be careful you're not giving it more attention than it deserves to the detriment of something - or someone - else. $\", '^ You have two primary planets, in other words those planets which affect and influence your zodiac sign. And the Free Radical of this pair, Uranus, today powers its way into the most vivacious part of your solar horoscope to begin a seven year residency. The great thing is that some of the brilliant ideas you have had for some while, can now become actuality. $', \"^ Today's Full Moon occurs in the difficult-to-define area of your chart associated with secrets, all that is hidden as well as your connection with organizations and institutions. Accompanying aspects though, indicate a significant and long-term shift in a relationship and every Aquarian will have their own story to tell about what transpires where a particular commitment is involved. Be aware though of the difference between 'winning' and 'gaining what you truly need'. $\", '^ Take a look at your lifestyle and reflect on how you can improve matters. You may want to focus on your eating habits, and notice how these affect you for good or ill. A little reflection may yield astonishing insights. Then get out in the fresh air and recharge your batteries. You function best when you allow life to become delightful, and you are relaxed. $', '^ This is one of those times when a mixture of your natural detachment and ability to understand the weird and wonderful elements of human nature, can be very helpful to you. Why? Well, you could be seriously put out by someones irritating attitude, but if you can take a step back, chuckle and see them for what they really are, it really will help. $', \"^ If we want others to be open and honest with us, then it is not only fair we act in similar ways with them, it's essential. It appears openness and honesty are needed in an area of your world now, but to attain both, you're going to have to be willing to be at least a bit more open with a particular person than you perhaps been of late. You want to know where you stand in some way. So too, does someone else. It's time to make clear not only what you think, but what you feel, too. $\", \"^ You might be able to recognize the benefits of being detached from a certain situation or arrangement on one level, but also appear keen to ensure you're involved fully with it. It's not so much a case of finding a balance between the two but focusing instead on how you can offer support or insight from a distance. If this has worked fine so far, then there's probably no need to get in the middle of it all. Remember the old saying about too many cooks spoiling the broth. $\", \"^ If you've become more skilled recently at biting your tongue, counting to ten or doing whatever you believe is required to refrain from speaking your mind in no uncertain terms, then it appears your ability to do so might need to be extended just a little bit longer. For now, it might suit you and someone else to believe they have an upper hand or should be allowed, briefly, to believe they're right and what they say goes. A shift in this balance of power in your favor is coming. $\", '^ Your health and lifestyle are in focus from today as Mars enters Cancer, encouraging you to take action on diet and exercise issues. You have been thinking about all of this for some time, now is your chance to actually do something. If you need expert advice it may help to call in a personal trainer, or even a fitness savvy friend. $', '^ Someone may let slip something you have told them in confidence. If this is a deeply private matter, this can leave you feeling red faced but also angry. There can be some genuine misunderstandings over the next few weeks, but equally things can go awry because someone is not being completely honest with you. Despite recent high points, chose confidants carefully. $', \"^ You might feel you're falling short of others' expectations or aren't safe from anyone's criticisms. However, you could be prone to feeling insecure or lacking in self-confidence regardless of who comes across as critical. You're not above being willing to self-improve but could be setting personal standards too high, and others are holding you to them. Lowering what you expect from yourself helps others to view your contributions realistically. $\", \"^ Among many things emotions are capable of doing is 'blinding' us. We are often encouraged to think and react more with our hearts than our heads but now is not such a time. You look likely to react emotionally to a certain situation or request made of you. Allow emotions in measured doses to play a part in your response but allow your head to offer the most practical solution. It would be too easy to apply a pragmatic solution to one that requires imagination and sensitivity. $\", \"^ Does making a certain decision daunt you? Do you have reservations about committing yourself in some way? Commitment always comes with some degree of risk and we all know the feeling that accompanies signing our name on a dotted line. It's time to decide what you want and are prepared to do where a certain relationship is concerned. You have all you need to have available to make the decision that needs making. $\", \"^ When we find ourselves fearful of standing up for ourselves in some way, we can often overlook how certain people actually want to be stood up to. Some even deliberately engineer situations in the hope doing so will evoke a particular response from someone they would like to evoke a response from. Where you might feel hesitant standing up for yourself or making clear a point in a way that causes some level of concern within you, consider the fact that you're about to pass a particular test with flying colors. $\", '^ This is one of those days when you may wonder what the heck is going on. Life may seem to be going everywhere and nowhere. Blame it on the Solar Eclipse, which may make you aware of just how much you need to change some of your most stubborn habits. Start with just one of them  it doesnt have to be the worst. Make a commitment to eradicate them one by one. $', \"^ If we keep telling ourselves something we suspect is true is actually true, then we eventually begin to believe it. That applies to anything we tell ourselves and it works in both negative and positive ways. With that in mind, it's important to take a step back from a situation and consider that you might be making an assumption that is at risk of becoming a set in stone fact in your mind. Even if you have managed to convince yourself of an untruth, keep it to yourself. $\", \"^ Doing what pleases you should be top of your list today and if you can postpone tedious tasks, then try to do so. That's not being irresponsible or lazy, it's sensible given the astrological climate affecting you presently. Immersing yourself in a dreamy world or allowing a fantasy or two to receive your attention has more benefits than disbenefits now. It might feel unusual but succumbing to what's unusual can make you surprisingly productive now. $\", \"^ A steep learning curve has prevailed recently. You've had to identify lessons available within experiences, some of which have appeared out of the blue. This frustrating and possibly painful process now moves into a second phase. This doesn't involve more of the same. It involves you understanding how you've changed and intend to apply your newfound wisdom in the future. $\", \"^ Perhaps, you're inclined to follow rather than lead in some way. You might be able to see how, with more effort and belief, you could offer something valuable and play an integral part in transforming an otherwise uncertain or rudderless scenario. But you might also question 'what's in it for you' to invest more time and effort. Where you might prefer others took the lead, be willing to offer some of your experience-based wisdom. $\", '^ Your more quirky side makes an appearance today. The desire to wear odd socks of different styles just for a blast, or to eat cheese and jam sandwiches marks you out as one in a million. You arent doing this to get attention but because you are not afraid to be yourself. Part of your appeal is your love of doing the opposite to what everyone else does! $', \"^ Once again, the issue surrounding what you have to offer a certain individual or possibly an organization is presenting itself. You might not have aspirations or be expected to change the world but it definitely appears you can make a difference to someone's world simply by allowing them to benefit from your wisdom and experience. If you sense you can make a difference in such a way, then allow yourself to be taken to where whatever-it-is you can offer is needed. $\", \"^ There's a lot to be said for goal setting. In fact, there is much said about it. Some people make impressive sums of money holding such seminars. You needn't attend one unless you want to, of course. You've some very strong celestial assistance to help focus on what you truly want now. Prepare to be enlightened and motivated in ways you might not have been in some time. $\", '^ Although you can be one of the most loyal of family members, there is another side of you which puts great store on your friendships. However, someone in your clan may find a more outspoken member of your circle hard to be around. You may also find yourself rather more tongue tied than you have been recently. Try to choose your words with care. $', \"^ Nobody's asking you to forgive and forget. We recognize you're not that nave. But someone appreciates the fact that you're willing to see a past troublesome situation in a more positive light. You might be underestimating the medium to long term benefits of doing this. Keep thinking the way you appear to be thinking now. $\", \"^ Everyone has a list of what would make them happier. We all have needs, material or otherwise, that we believe being fulfilled or met would solve many problems. We tend to overlook though how feeling better about ourselves can play a big part of much of what we need being made available to us. Prepare to see for yourself how a 'feel good factor' can work on your behalf. $\", \"^ Sometimes, when people drive too carefully, they cause accidents. It's a fact. Focus gets given too intently on certain aspects of what we're doing and little or no attention gets given to others when that happens. We end up creating the very problem we were so anxious to avoid creating. Be careful how much focus you give to something now. It needs and deserves less attention than you probably believe it does. Relax and let a process unfold gradually and in its own time. If you can, you will reduce or eliminate altogether any risk of inadvertently causing a problem. $\", \"^ There's always debate about whether we give to make others feel good or if we do so to make ourselves feel good. As long as we're giving, does it matter? Sometimes though, by giving, we create expectation in the minds of recipients. When we explain our reasons for not continuing to give, we're seen as selfish and unreasonable. Someone believes you'll always give in some way. Understand that you're not being selfish by encouraging them to provide for themselves. $\", \"^ Some spare tires are designed to be driven short distances only. They work fine enough but are only intended for short distances until a more suitable replacement can be fitted. Somewhere in your world, you're having to 'make do' with what you believe to be a barely suitable arrangement. Trust that it is temporary and a more appropriate and permanent solution is coming. $\", \"^ It can be quite easy sometimes to identify someone's profession by the way they speak. Many doctors, lawyers, policemen and scientists are often easiest to spot by the way the phrase sentences or certain observations they make. The way we think on a day-to-day basis often influences the way we convey ourselves. It might be possible for someone to gain interesting insight into an aspect of your personality now simply by the way you're choosing your words. $\", \"^ In fairy tales, giants are fearsome characters. So too are dragons. Heroes or heroines know the best time to trick a giant or dragon is when they're asleep. Then, just as the character looks set to escape, something wakes the giant or dragon. You have an opportunity to secretly gain something you need. Be prepared to act swiftly if it doesn't meet with someone else's approval. $\", \"^ A common astrological theme surrounds 'control'  or perhaps more control  in a particular area. Even when we feel we do have control, we're forced to accept that we have no control over situations we're unable to foresee. While volatility exists now, you'd be much better advised to release control of certain situations, even just a little bit, rather the struggle to retain it. $\", \"^ Albert Einstein is quoted as saying, 'the more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know'. It takes courage and an ability to push any hint of arrogance aside to make such a statement. In some way now, you're involved in a learning process that could be coming from a source you're disinclined to give due credit to. It might even be a particular person who is enlightening you in ways you might not be quick to accept. What matters is, you ARE learning something valuable. $\", \"^ How willing are you to meet someone 'halfway'? I'm referring to preparedness on your part to accept another person's offer or proposal is probably as good as an arrangement is going to get. You can gain much now through pushing aside and ignoring a long list of reasons why what's being discussed should be more in your favor. A satisfying agreement can be reached if you're willing to discard something from your past that prevents you from moving forward. $\", \"^ A situation doesn't have to remain as it is. If asked, you would know instantly what you would do to change it. So, what's stopping you? Perhaps, this has something to do with suspecting how much change and upheaval would come your way were you to bring about the change you long to see happen. There are consequences to a decision you're pondering now. Some of these might even be controversial. You know, however, what is necessary and why. Trust that. $\", \"^ Inertia you might have experienced when focusing efforts in particular ways could appear to vanish. Where you might draw upon past experience of giving your all and getting nothing in return, you could be surprised at how easily what was difficult or awkward previously becomes. Don't let past precedents stop you from tackling what appears problematic. Circumstances are different now. $\", \"^ Contracts tend to be written in ways to encourage the skipping over of technical jargon and 'lawyer speak' and for signatures to be scribbled swiftly to close the deal. What's being discussed or agreed now needs closer examination. Make sure you know precisely what you're agreeing or committing to. All might not be as clear as someone else wants you to believe. $\", \"^ The fact you're reading this forecast is clear indication that you've some level of faith in 'that which cannot always be explained'. You're willing to consider something that might offer insight outside realms of what others consider to be logic or prescriptive. With that in mind, push aside a desire to adopt a logical approach to something that requires you to be more open-minded. $\", \"^ Everything we do starts with a thought. When we visualize something, we don't see it as a word, we see it as a clearly defined image in our mind. There's something you need to see more clearly in your mind if a certain plan is to be successful or even launched. Don't get too bogged down with minutiae. What our minds can conceive, we can achieve. Let your imagination help you now. Have faith in your ability to make happen what it is you're visualizing now. $\", \"^ The situation in the cosmos for your sign is complex. It mirrors a similar situation in your world that you wish you could know, once and for all, where you stand with a certain person or organization and to what extent you're being led by them. You sense there is more to a situation and are unsure how to make this uncertainty clear. An opportunity is about to present itself. $\", \"^ People in Third World countries have been told that, to clear their debt, they must cut down rain forests. They're then instructed not to cut down rain forests because of massive environmental implications. We can hardly blame them for being confused! For some time, you've received contradictory demands from someone who wants you to do X and then demands you do Y instead. Trust that this frustrating and counterproductive scenario is finally coming to an end. $\", \"^ Life has a habit of sweeping us up with its momentum. Quite often, we recognize that we have no choice other than to allow ourselves to be swept up and address whatever issues we find ourselves having to address as we go along. Now is such a time for you. You're aware of how quickly a process is moving. A situation you had grown used to and comfortable has altered. Understand that its direction can be dictated by you, despite how strongly someone else feels. $\", \"^ You could resent losing some degree of personal freedom, especially within a relationship at this time. A loved one and potential partner may try to impose a restriction or demand that you toe the line in some way. If that's the case, then they clearly don't know you well, do they? You're not likely to accept or tolerate their demands if you sense you're pushed to conform. It might be time to put someone in the picture about limits that exist surrounding what you will and won't be told to do. $\", \"^ All it takes sometimes is one problem to rear its head and we become convinced that everything else is either going awry or about to do so. We believe ourselves to be cursed or fighting unseen forces determined to thwart our every move. It does appear a certain plan is proving painful to make happen but don't let that isolated issue deter or discourage you from focusing on what is right and positive. It's important you give attention to what or whom is cooperating and helpful. $\", \"^ In some way, you're being encouraged to be a sponge; willing to absorb as much information as possible. This appears to be integral to you conveying your communicating yourself in a specific way and, to do so effectively, you're going to need to be armed with facts. Allow a bit of time to become enlightened in ways you aren't currently. As more facts find their way to you, the stronger your case will be when the time comes to state it. $\", \"^ We can spend much valuable time trying to find something right under our noses. We ignore what is immediately available or familiar because we fail to recognize how helpful it can actually be through familiarity or complacency. So, we embark upon lengthy and time consuming quests that we needn't have embarked upon. A similar situation exists in your world now. Look a bit closer to home for what you really need now. Something really is, quite literally, within your reach. $\", '^ Your talent for friendship is legendary. Expect loads of people to want to be \"in your gang\" today and it can be gratifying to know that this is so. Part of this comes from your inclusive attitude. Your kindness and tendency to not deny people, simply because they are different to you, is something many other people could learn from Aquarius. $', \"^ Party magician and mind reader tricks using seemingly complex mathematical formulae that always give the same answer no matter what numbers are chosen. We know there's nothing magical or psychic about this. Similarly, don't allow yourself to be fooled by a belief that, to get what you need, something is incredibly complex and beyond your capabilities. A path to progress really is more straightforward than someone wants you to believe. $\", \"^ 'Do as I say and not as I do'. People in positions of authority love saying such things. Often, we find ourselves wondering why such people rarely do as they tell others to do. You're receiving conflicting and unhelpful advice. You want to do something 'by the book' but are confused as to why others get away with not doing so. Do what you know to be right and you cannot fail. You don't need as much guidance or input as you suspect you do. $\", \"^ Some hidden worries may be best spoken about. What's going to be important is that you talk to someone that you can absolutely trust. Letting on about confidential issues to someone who has not got your best interests at heart, could see them gossip, so don't give them this power or opportunity. Yawn out any tensions that have taken hold. $\", \"^ How dare those who compare Aquarians to Mr Spock in 'Star Trek'. As fascinating as he was in many ways, he was, shall we say, a bit on the emotionally challenged side. But anyone who views someone born under your sign in such a way clearly doesn't understand you or the way you're wired. An unselfish act on your part will soon cause someone to think differently about how emotionally detached they viewed you. $\", \"^ Years ago, adverts appeared in comic books for 'X-Ray Specs'. With these, you were able to 'see' through clothing and flesh. A great gimmick, but we never see adverts for rose-tinted spectacles despite demand for them and the fact they're so widely used. How realistic are you being where your opinion of someone is concerned? It could be time to accept they may not be quite so deserving of the pedestal you've put them on. $\", \"^ Your motivation levels could be high at this time, but you might be unsure of the best ways to focus them. You might see how success is likely in one area and then decide another area appeals more. That's one of the disbenefits of having options  we don't always know which one to throw ourselves into first! However, applying a bit of caution before wading straight in will provide you with helpful, missing information. $\", \"^ What does someone see when they look at you? Do they see a person capable of making their own accurate judgements and decisions or someone whose head is only capable of bobbing up and down, saying 'yes' to everything? You might believe a certain person sees you as the latter and demands being made of you to comply with their wishes and requests could be starting to become wearying. Make clear how you're willing to support them but only to a fair point. $\", \"^ Doubt requires little encouragement. It can manifest itself easily and instantly if we require it to do so. All it takes is one word of jealousy or discouragement from someone else and it springs into action, agreeing wholeheartedly with what's being said. Soon, you'll have good reason to feel optimistic where you've been doubtful or perhaps lacking in confidence. $\", \"^ We all ponder the meaning of life. Why are we here? How did we get here? Life, as we know, is a constant series of choices. In the same way we have to pass certain signposts when driving to a destination, we do the same to arrive at situations we find ourselves in. Don't believe you may have taken a wrong turn some time ago because of what you're dealing with now. You really are at an important and essential point that will soon be a springboard to something wonderful. $\", \"^ You know you can't continue giving effort in ways you have been of late indefinitely so accept there's nothing to be embarrassed about if a need to step back or detach yourself from a project or plan becomes necessary. Watching from the sidelines could rejuvenate your interest or provide a new level of inspiration that can be applied at a later date. It's not as if you're flogging a dead horse, as they say, just one that could use a break as much as you could now. $\", \"^ When decisions are mixed with emotion, then they can sometimes be made hastily. Sometimes though, a dose of healthy emotion is precisely what we need to make some decisions or summon courage where we need to. You can bring a pleasing development or progress by allowing yourself to be guided a little bit more by emotion and insight. Both can take the cold or insensitive edge off what might otherwise be a 'spur of the moment' decision made with your head now. $\", \"^ Health issues may be brought on by powerful subconscious forces which are trying to get your attention. Pluto in your spiritual zone may have a message for you. It's hinting that it may be time to change your ways and to listen to your heart. Just a small transformation in your daily habits and lifestyle can have a profound impact. $\", '^ You can appreciate the nuances in financial discussions. If you are self-employed or hold a position at work which requires business decisions, you could do very well. But to ensure this, you may need to put to one side that more idealistic side of yours. You are unlikely to be able to keep everyone happy, and need to be hard headed to succeed. $', \"^ 'If you love someone, set them free. If they come back, they're yours. If they don't, they never were'. You have, during recent weeks, been involved in a process that has 'freed' you from certain commitments, obligations or habits. What's meant to be part of your world will return soon enough. What isn't has been removed and is something you're better off without. $\", \"^ The sky is urging you to be careful whom you confide in now. There appears to be one person in particular who could unintentionally make your secret known to the person or people you wanted it kept hidden from. It's not that they have a big mouth. They're just prone to opening it without thinking now. $\", \"^ If final monies are being collected on a group outing to see a show or to head off overseas, someones lack of personal responsibility can disappoint you. Try not to upset yourself too much about this. By realising that not everyone lives to the type of credo that you do and that your standards can be incredibly high, you'll see something can yet be worked out. $\", \"^ It might take a bit of time for you to shift from top gear to neutral, but the cosmos appears keen help you slow down in some way. You could be getting so close to a situation or are applying your efforts so fervently that you're overlooking how timely it could be to come to a halt and take stock of where you're at. If the next phase of a plan is about to commence, then you have ideal cosmic support to create a sensible action plan to underpin it. $\", \"^ You might be surprised at your willingness to abide by certain rules, especially in the workplace at this time. However, you're likely to have serious reservations about others' abilities to steer one plan to success. You could be aware of what you'd do differently if you were in charge but might have to accept the fact that others simply aren't on the same page as you. You can see what they cannot see in a situation but are wise to refrain from creating any ripples - for now. $\", \"^ You put a unique stamp on all you do, and the urge to make your mark, state your case or consolidate a relationship could intensify as today's Full Moon Lunar Eclipse influences partnerships or one in particular. You could also be reminded of how complex one commitment or arrangement has become. Nonetheless, you've been aware of how one connection has needed to change in a way that suits your needs better, and that's what the cosmos is assisting with now. $\", \"^ The sky insists a surprise is in store for you. Might its idea of a surprise differ from you own? We can be surprised to receive bills we weren't expecting. We can be surprised to receive news we weren't expecting. Oh dear. I'm casting a bit of a gloomy picture, aren't I? Might that be because you're priming yourself for confrontation already? You can relax and be assured the surprise coming your way will indeed make you smile. $\", \"^ You might be aware of how you're having to play a frustrating waiting game in a particular area and accepting that patience is going to play an integral part in a plan is wise. You might see no reason why a result isn't forthcoming immediately but might also be overlooking certain complexities in the process. For now, trust that you're where you need to be. Trying to force any developments isn't going to help you pass time constructively. $\", '^ You can find most of the answers you need most of the time, but there can be benefits to allowing yourself to be assisted with a little help from your friends or one in particular. Try not to be so defensive or protective toward something you ought to allow someone the chance to offer insight with. Their fresh and detached approach could be precisely what your cherished plan needs. $', \"^ You don't have to beg. Neither do you have to plead with, cajole or manipulate someone to get them to accept your way of thinking. A certain person needs convincing and getting their agreement would be very helpful but it's important you recognize the balance of power is in your favor. You have something they want. They know you have it, so let them do all of the talking. $\", '^ Mercury is in your health zone, this encourages you to take a look at the many possibilities for keeping as fit and fantastic as you want to be. Sometimes your insecurities go to your stomach, causing you to suffer from indigestion and other problems. Try to make deep relaxation a regular thing. It can help in lots of unforeseen ways. $', \"^ If effort invested in a particular area has you feeling as you're taking one step forward and three steps backward, then it might be time to look at how you're applying yourself. You could discover your methodology is more sporadic than you thought it was. Taking things a bit more slowly will help you to become more effective and efficient. You're probably not up against the clock in ways you believe yourself to be, either. $\", '^ You may sense that some people you need to get along with dont necessarily share your preference for doing things in an open way. In fact, there can be quite a lot of intrigue going on now, so your hunches could be spot on. But equally, may be you need to be realistic that politics are part and parcel of life. Indeed, you may pull some confidential moves yourself. $', \"^ Words are great and have 'their place,' but most people want to see action reinforcing them. We feel more reassured when others 'put their money where their mouth is.' However, it's ironic that someone in your world is in no doubt about what you're capable of but wants words to support it! You might have to explain or reiterate why you're doing something a particular way but can convey this superbly while you continue to let your actions speak for themselves. $\", \"^ You can see what will be required from you to take an idea or vision from a conceptual stage to something tangible. However, the bold step you're prepared to take could suddenly be cut short by doubts. If you convince yourself as you take your place on the starting line that you'll fall short of your goals, then you're halfway to doing so. What you see as an intriguing possibility needs as much positivity as you can summon for it. $\", \"^ An imbalance exists where things were, not so long ago, balanced. You and a certain person still have an issue to resolve or at least reach a compromise about, even if it is to agree to disagree. A dispute can be resolved if you're prepared to accept what you've learned and someone else accepts that they went a tiny bit overboard in making their point. $\", \"^ Although you might believe you can see clearly the error contained in someone's plan or methodology, that doesn't mean it's your responsibility to highlight it. Whatever error you spot is one that will reveal itself in time without your intervention. Someone's enthusiastic bubble doesn't need bursting because you believe yourself to be extra astute. Show support from the sidelines and let a process take care of itself. $\", '^ The Moon can do wonders for you this weekend, helping to anchor down your emotions. Being an Air sign as you are, there can be a tendency to intellectualize situations and your own feelings, rather than accepting them readily. Whatever is happening for you now Aquarius, whether it is joyous or difficult do treasure your inner diversity and complexities. $', \"^ A fresh start unfolding in your world might bring with it a new level of responsibility. However, this is a small price to pay for a much-improved change. Rather than focus on a new demand made of you, focus instead on where you now have control over what you haven't felt able to control recently. The cosmos appears to be allowing you to have something your way but, for this to happen, a situation can't remain as it has been. Increased responsibility on your part is a clear sign of progress. That's something to celebrate, not resent. $\", '^ By dealing promptly with any obstacles, misfires or certain underlying worries, you can avoid hassles later on. The current planetary movements range between a quick-step and a slow-motion foxtrot. As long as you pace the weeks timing and add a dab of extra networking to your plans, the stars will lend you more than one supportive dance routine. $', \"^ Reacting defensively to a fear or concern isn't the answer. You might have reasons for believing it's sensible to become more self-protective or consider a negative outcome. However, as a situation progresses, you'll be granted enough reasons to feel optimistic and hopeful. For now, resist any urge to nurture pessimism. That's wasted energy that can be harnessed and focused much more productively. $\", \"^ It's interesting how setting ourselves free from something - or someone - always involves assessing what we stand to lose and gain. If we know, in our hearts, that we need to sever a tie or commitment, then we ought to be focused solely on what the benefits are. That's easier said than done, though. You're aware of action you need to take to bring about tense change in an arrangement. Soon, it will become clear how much you do stand to gain from doing so. $\", '^ If you have been painstakingly marshalling your resources and it feels that others, even if not everybody, is having an easier time of it than you, keep sight of what your long term aims were and are. It may be that you are further along the road in this journey than you realize. If you stick with things diligently, you will eventually get your reward Aquarius. $', \"^ How much more are you willing to give or invest toward the pursuit of a particular goal or ambition? The word 'more' can relate to many things, but you are likely to be aware of how your patience and resources have been tested recently and are right to be assessing how much 'more' you're prepared to give. The saying 'if at first you don't succeed, try reading the instructions' applies now. A tiny tweak to your plan could be all that's needed to revive your interest in it. $\", \"^ The Full Moon Penumbral Lunar Eclipse that occurs in your sign could be tricky for anyone apart from you to narrow down ways it's most likely to affect you. This has much to do with the fact that is falls in your first house, a place where your deepest secrets reside comfortably within. Coming events could bring a brief clash between how you're seen by others and what you choose to keep concealed. In some way, both are about to merge, and allow the world to see the real you. $\", \"^ A quiet Christmas day may not seem to be your scene, but there is a lot going on at a very personal level and psychologically. Even while other people are pitching into the fun with gusto, you may find your mind wandering off to people from your past. If you've encountered any separations lately or in 2009, you can be especially conscious of them. $\", \"^ A certain person definitely appears integral to a plan that means a great deal to you, but it appears that getting them to cooperate or see your point of view is proving difficult. If getting someone on your side is important, then try changing your 'selling' tactics. Perhaps you-know-who isn't entirely 'sold' on the benefits to them of helping you. $\", \"^ You're right to expect a process of change to require time to unfold properly but there's much you can do in the meantime. You might see a time in the distance when you'll be in a better position to seize a particular chance but it will need you to be ready immediately when it presents itself. With more effort and confidence, you can learn a bit more that you know, in your heart, you need to learn. Keep chipping away at a goal and tangible success will come sooner than you think. $\", \"^ When we're young, we're encouraged to ask questions. Interestingly, we're also encouraged to talk and then told to be quiet! With such contradiction from such a young age, it's no wonder we struggled or were confused. You're being encouraged now to speak your mind but in a measured way. Someone might not like all you have to say but it's in their best interests to hear it. $\", \"^ Salespeople learn to 'think on their feet'. When given objections from potential buyers, they need to have answers quickly. Even if they're not ideal ones, at least the sales process keeps moving along. You're about to be expected to provide a quick response in some way. Honesty and faith will ensure your reply is more than satisfactory. $\", \"^ We need plans if plans are to go to plan. We can sometimes get by on a proverbial wing and prayer but the act of making plans goes a long way to ensuring their success. That's why it's important you don't deviate from a clear plan you set some time ago. As tempting as it might be to abandon it, you'll soon see why you ought to be sticking with it. Relax, and keep going. $\", \"^ In the same way a straight stick in water appears bent, something in your world has potential to be misleading. You needn't guard yourself too heavily against this, the sky is on your side and intends to ensure you're protected and well looked after, but you are likely to have to address something you believe is giving a false impression. Trust what you believe to be true and real. $\", \"^ If we're feeling down, forcing a smile can bring an instant, and, at times, amazing change to how we feel. Something as simple as a smile can alter at attitude and the way we choose to react toward a situation. Is that contrived? Is it artificial? Who cares? We often overestimate how much effort is required on our part to bring levels of relief and happiness into our world. To experience both now, all you need to do now allow both unrestricted access and they'll come to you. $\", \"^ In the absence of certain information, we have no option other than to guess. Guessing tends to be more effective when it's done in an 'educated' way. When we don't take careful consideration of what it is we're guessing about, then all we're basically doing is clutching at proverbial straws. You might have reason to believe guessing is a less than reliable way to arrive at a particular decision now but the sky insists your ability to guess correctly is more reliable than you think. $\", \"^ Be willing to put yourself in the proverbial shoes of a certain person to truly understand what they think or feel. If you sense there might be more to their situation or that they're putting on a brave face for everyone else's benefit, then trust what your instincts tell you. Your intuition could send you a very clear and accurate message about a sensitive or compassionate gesture you can make that tells them you're on their side or understand what they're experiencing. $\", '^ Hot off the planetary press, a trail of planets will begin to stir a spirit of renewal. Also, expect a small but marked improvement in business, creative and any social link-ups. The temptation of a get-away from it all break will be strong. You will undoubtedly benefit from a rest. Keep any delays and other hitches in perspective. Its time to keep moving on. $', '^ Keep a little bit of your more quirky nature in check. You are probably the \"most natural\" of all the zodiac signs and can dislike the synthetic games that life can ask of you, or that others play. But if you are trying to get along - especially professionally, sometimes it is important to understand what the expectations are of those in the positions of power. $', \"^ The obstacle navigating your way around now is likely to be a blessing in disguise. It is understandable you don't see the situation in quite that way though. You are being steered toward a particular destination and, despite how slow it may appear, you are making progress. Accept that the cosmos really does know what it's doing and has your best interests at heart. $\", \"^ Help often comes from unexpected quarters. It also has a tendency to manifest in ways we don't expect it to. Help you need in some way is coming. The surprise surrounding its arrival will come through it being summoned from within you. You hold the very answer you seek where help you believe you need is concerned now. $\", \"^ Wanting to do something your way makes sense to you but could be met with resistance by someone you could do with having on your side. You might believe you have an accurate assessment of what needs doing and why it needs doing your way but being receptive to someone's input could reveal a gap in your strategy. Try to be flexible where flexibility is needed. $\", '^ Dont give in to temptation - though it seems like a great idea. Neptune is in your sign so the urge to escape from all that you have known and loved is major. You want to be lulled into a false sense of security and made to feel as though you are being looked after by a benevolent power. Instead, seize the day and dont be passive. $', \"^ We know what too much pepper or spice can do to a recipe. We are given suggested guidelines for such levels but can choose to ignore them. Much depends on our taste preference and pain thresholds, I suppose. Yet, if we inadvertently add too much of either, we're left with something far from palatable. Your desire to inject a bit of excitement in an area of your world is understandable. Try to stick within the guidelines surrounding what is reasonable! $\", '^ Jupiter is that largest planet out there and it now starts to travel forwards again, in your sign, where it will be until mid-January 2010. This is a fantastic opportunity to get ahead, but you cant be passive about it. Fortunately the Suns angle to Neptune this week, suggests you wont be short of the inspiration or the imagination to do so. Get to it! $', \"^ Something in your world could appear mirage-like. Just as you think you've arrived or it's within grasp, it moves further into the distance. However, a large part of frustration might stem from eagerness to seize what isn't quite 'ripe' or is shifting due to it being on unstable ground currently. For now, keep your eye on the prize until it settles to the point where grabbing it becomes easier. A bit of patience is all that's needed. $\", \"^ You appear to be looking at something or someone suspiciously now. What are your reasons for doubting it or them? A situation is only partly yours to be involved with and it's true someone appears to be imposing limits to how involved they want you to be but there is no hidden agenda. Ignore feelings of doubt now. $\", '^ All too often, we look at a particular situation in the belief it is what it is and cannot be changed. We resign ourselves to a need to accept it and live with that. Yet, with any less than desirable situation, we do have options where we believe none exist and one of these involves our attitude toward it. A situation in your world is might appear impossible to change but the sky insists a change of attitude toward it can bring a very helpful and delightful revelation. $', \"^ Grass might be greener elsewhere as you consider what life might be like in a different setting or how responsibilities might diminish if you were able to relocate to where you believe the sun shines every day. In truth, you don't need to look into the far-off distance to increase comfort and stability in your world now. As appealing as it might be to consider a fresh start elsewhere, give the present a chance to confirm how well-placed you are where you are, right here, right now. $\", \"^ Is there more to a certain situation than what you see or are being told? It's very likely that's the case. Although you could discover something concealed in a particular situation, you could be wrong to see it as deliberately deceptive. What you discover can replace pessimism with optimism, as long as you're willing to see the hidden advantage in what comes to light. $\", \"^ When looking at distance between two cities on a map, distance appears small. Roads appear as colored lines. It all appears straightforward. Once we begin our journey, we then discover more about what it will involve and what we need to look out for or be careful of. There is something in your world that you have looked at and assessed for long enough. It's time to embark upon a 'journey' that the sky insists you will benefit from enormously. Take the brave step now. $\", '^ Valentines Day begins with a New Moon in your sign, the best one of the year for you. You get the opportunity for a new beginning in any area of life you choose, including your love life. If you want to get engaged this is a great time to do so. Be bold and take your current relationship to dizzy heights. Forget being cool  wear your heart on your sleeve. $', \"^ Puzzles are usually indulged in for pleasure. If, however, we find them to be too taxing for the brain or just plain dull, we'll soon find something else to focus our attention on. But how many times have you decided a puzzle, crossword, whatever was too much hard work and walked away from it only to return to it because you refused to let it get the better of you? As you return to a particular quandary or puzzling scenario, expect it to finally start making sense. $\", \"^ You have the right to respond to a tricky or uncomfortable offer in a way that suits you. That's the thing, though. Are you, through choosing to respond in a certain way, doing what only suits you? Might there be someone else's thoughts or feelings to take into consideration? A certain person seems to have made monumental effort to explain how they feel in the hope that a bridge can at least be built. You can, if you wish, ensure that so much more can be achieved. $\", \"^ Hands of the clock move forward. That's just the way it is and will always be. We are incapable of physically turning back time. We have no option but to accept that every moment we are granted is gone once we have experienced it. Fortunately, we are granted many moments in a twenty-four hour period. Sometimes, we are amazed at what can develop in such a short space of time. Prepare to be amazed at the development that occurs in an area of your world now. $\", \"^ It might be necessary to accept limitations that exist regarding your knowledge of a particular topic or your capabilities. Sir Richard Branson might believe it's best to agree that you can offer what someone needs and be concerned about how you're going to do it later, but such a philosophy is unlikely to work for you at this time. Sometimes, it's best to say, 'I don't know' or 'I don't know but am willing to learn' rather than try to bluff our way with what emerges from the back end of a bull. $\", \"^ Discipline and logic need summoning now. You could be experiencing a surge of ideas, and as exciting as each might be, you can't give attention to them all. Make an effort to prioritize what truly deserves your attention and focus effort that direction. Any wonderful ideas that need to be put on the shelf briefly will wait for your attention when the time's right to give it. $\", '^ Ask one hundred people for their opinion and there will usually be consistency to what those who bother to reply say. That confirms how alike many of us think. It also confirms that, to any question, there is often a very obvious answer yet, even when we know this to be true, we still cling to the notion that another might exist. You could spend valuable time trying to identify an answer to something you know the answer to - or you could trust and listen to your heart. $', \"^ Many people believe that career satisfaction is all about finding a job you like and adding it to five or six days of the week. We're all aware of how much of our lives is spent in a work environment, and reasons why we should do all we can to enjoy it. Although that's often much easier said than done, an opportunity is about to present itself that can do much to boost your career-related morale. A chance to be at least more satisfied than you are is coming. $\", \"^ It's possible to apply too much care toward a plan you believe is at risk of going off on an unhelpful tangent. It's important to recognize what is and isn't within your ability to influence because a line appears to exist surrounding control you have and control you wish you had. Even if all you see is a lack of action or no tangible sign of progress, don't ignore what might be occurring behind the scenes. You might not be able to accelerate or steer a certain process, but that's helpful at this stage, not unhelpful. $\", \"^ Go this way. Go that way. Now, try this. Actually, it might best to try that. Now, start. Ooops. I meant go backwards. As much as the above might sound like instructions being given by a crazed driving instructor, they're similar to instructions being given between your head and your heart at present. Here's a hint: the most confusing instructions are coming from your head. $\", \"^ We don't know if Leonardo da Vinci had a friend watching over his shoulder as he painted the Mona Lisa. 'I think a bit more black is needed there, Leo' or 'Hang on, let me see what it looks like when I stand back a bit' might have been a couple of suggestions made. Perhaps, someone else played an integral part in the creation of the masterpiece. Maybe though, it is fair Leonardo received full credit for having had the idea in the first place. Similarly, credit that you are due is about to come to you. You made something happen and that is all that matters. $\", \"^ Imagine what might have resulted if some of the most inventive and pioneering people in history set themselves easily-achievable goals. To make spectacular things happen, we need to set some high expectations at times and that's something you're being encouraged to do now. Clearly, you know the line that exists between achievable and unrealistic. However, something exciting and inspiring can result from crossing it briefly. Try it and see what happens. $\", \"^ Once again, you're being looked to for leadership or guidance in a particular way. As willing as you might be to provide either or both, your response needs you to draw upon facts and experience, rather than speculation. To involve yourself in a way you're being asked requires you to know precisely how someone views your involvement. $\", \"^ What's said by someone in a subtle or off the cuff way could fire your imagination and give you plenty to think about. They might not be able to see the power or potential that exists in what they've said but you definitely can. It's important at this time that you make yourself as alert as possible to all forms of communication and what is said in all interactions. An idea that you will want to pull out all stops to explore could come your way. $\", '^ Your words have real power. Use them wisely and you can make rapid strides in a situation which has stalled. You have been through a testing time and do not feel like putting up with more of the same. Adjust the way you feel and talk about this issue, both to yourself and others. As you do, positive changes will happen. You will be back on form! $', \"^ We see tense or uncertain situations as being beyond or control to influence and whilst it's true we do have to wait sometimes until we can seize a chance to control them, many awkward or problematic scenarios are actually waiting for us to steer or control them. It's as if once they've manifested, they're unsure what they're supposed to do next! That's why you can and should take control of something you believe has the upper hand. It could be waiting for guidance from you. $\", \"^ You appear to have something to prove to a particular person. The sky implies the one person you need to impress or placate most is yourself. It's as if the cosmos is waiting for a sign from you that you truly want something before it assists you. The more you can summon confidence in your abilities and the stronger the signal you send, the greater your chances of success are. $\", \"^ Aquarian Franklin D. Roosevelt avoided travel on the thirteenth day of any month and never hosted thirteen guests at a meal. Many might say that doesn't sound like Aquarian behavior believing people born under your sign prefer hard facts to anything superstitious. However, be prepared to discover a pleasing development now to be one you cannot explain or rationalize. $\", \"^ Standing out from the crowd or choosing to do something your way probably comes easy for you and connecting with your ability to do both now will prove helpful. This could be particularly true if you're finding yourself having to stick with tired routines that suit others but strike you and painfully dull. You're the best person to inject spontaneity into what has become tedious, even if it goes against the grain of what suits others. $\", \"^ There are times when we try to be cleverer than we need to be. Thinking outside the box has its uses but we do ourselves and others a disservice when we apply strategies that don't need to be anywhere near as complex as we believe they should be. An area of your world could benefit from you 'playing it safe' rather than try to devise an innovative, groundbreaking solution. Relax and try to be responsive as opposed to intensely proactive. $\", \"^ People speak about 'rising above' problems. We are encouraged to look down upon rather than up at that which confuses or upsets us. There's much truth in the idea of making whatever irks us appear smaller and beneath us. You're being encouraged to do something similar now where an imbalance exists between you and someone else. A change in attitude could be all that's needed to swing the balance of control in your favor. Apply a psychological tactic. $\", \"^ If you feel as if your hand is being forced in some way, then avoid any temptation to resist the force. If you sense you're being pushed a certain direction, then relax and allow yourself to be guided that direction. Events unfolding now are doing so because they bring change that is going to remove you from what's outdated and insert you conveniently where you need to be. So relax. $\", '^ Trying to persuade key people to see things from your point of view may be difficult. If you have something important to discuss, wait until tomorrow, when you should have more luck. However, you seem keen to find ways to make money from home, which is becoming very possible. All it needs is faith and the willingness to persist. $', \"^ The smallest and most seemingly insignificant change to a routine situation can have a dramatic effect. Think, for example, how someone you pass daily without any exchange says 'hello' and transforms your connection with them instantly. One small alteration to a repetitive scenario can bring a helpful and pleasing development. Don't underestimate how you can bring a significant improvement to an area of your world by introducing a change that almost appears insignificant or even pointless. The knock-on effect of doing so could be very far-reaching. $\", \"^ By many people's standards you can come across as an unusual soul. For you, perhaps it's the rest of the world that seems rather crazy. But recently, it has been your very individuality that has been attracting admiring glances, or perhaps a full on hot pursuit. However, if you do have more than one admirer, treat your clan very gently indeed today. $\", '^ You are determined to move out of your comfort zone and aim for the success you deserve. At this stage it may help to do some research. Take a look at others who have succeeded and pick up some ideas from them. Knowledge will enable you to broaden your vision, and encourage you to aim for your hearts desire. The impossible becomes possible and easily within your grasp. $', \"^ Going solo or doing something in a way detached from others might bring satisfaction on one level but could represent an unexciting option on another. You might be able to achieve something spectacular on your own but might also recognize the benefits of having others to bounce your ideas off of and make helpful contributions to. It is possible to find balance. This might involve you emerging to reveal what you've been doing in solitude once you're reassured the time is right to do so. $\", \"^ You could be connected directly with others' feelings which would be fine if you didn't feel the ups and downs they do. Although you're normally quite self-reliant, with the Moon influencing relationships, you might find it difficult to detach yourself from what's occurring in the minds and hearts of others. However, this might be exactly what's needed to transform your interaction with one person. Your ability to understand what they're experiencing puts you in the best position to assist or support them. $\", '^ Romance is not just candlelit dinners, its about caring for one anothers needs and seeing that life can sometimes be a tough trudge. But despite this and your basically caring nature, you and someone close could be finding it hard to see eye to eye. Even a pushy person at work can aggravate you. Work at not taking things too personally today Aquarius. $', \"^ Some people don't bother looking at restaurant menus because they know, even before they arrived, what items they'd select. We all know what we like and like what we know. Straying from paths of comfort and predictability doesn't appeal to many folk but you are being encouraged to step outside of a well-trodden comfort zone. Don't fear the need to bring about a change. $\", \"^ We do some amazing things out of courtesy. If offered something by someone that we secretly want, we might refuse is politely. Why? Do we then believe we will be beholden to them for accepting what we were being offered? And if we do feel a need to reciprocate the gesture, is that really so bad? You can make a situation in your world much easier by being honest with yourself and someone else. Don't refuse what you know you really ought to be accepting from them. $\", \"^ We support beliefs that feel right. We are constantly aware of what we would like to believe in but if we choose not to, then it's usually because there's something about it that discourages us from doing so. We see a belief as a fantasy that couldn't possibly come true. We tried once before to make something become a reality and failed, so our belief has now waned or disappeared. Yet, you're now willing to believe what you once disbelieved. This is both timely and very helpful. $\", \"^ Fixing or improving what you know needs attention needn't require you to prime yourself for a battle or confrontation. Progress can be made if you're willing to see an issue in the right perspective, which involves seeing how small a part of a much bigger - and promising - picture it is. The issue you're focusing on is probably more trivial than you believe it to be. With patience and faith, you'll see in the perspective it should be seen in. $\", \"^ Anyone who has played 'connect the dots' knows how, once all dots have been joined, the final image isn't always easy to see. It's difficult to create anything circular or rounded and the overall picture is jagged and disjointed. Does it matter though? It's a 'connect the dots' picture, after all. It's not intended to be framed on a mantelpiece. Don't concern yourself too much with how something appears in your world now. It is temporary and will soon be irrelevant. $\", \"^ We need no convincing of the fact that two and two equals four. There is logic behind the statement that small children are capable of grasping. Yet, we make assumptions thinking we're applying similar levels of logic. We reach conclusions that are far from sound or factual. That's what you're at risk of doing now. It's very easy for you to look at a certain scenario in a critical or even bitter way without knowing all the facts. Leave room for insight to make itself known. $\", \"^ There's a saying that goes 'forgive your enemies, nothing annoys them more'. Your forecast doesn't involve enemies. It involves strength that forgiveness requires. You have a choice where your relationship with a certain person is concerned. You can mirror their aggressive tendencies or smile and be forgiving. The latter will transform and improve the situation in a wonderful way. $\", \"^ In the same way jumbo jets must work hard to become airborne, you too are having to invest more energy than you'd like to be investing in a personal matter or arrangement. In the same way aircrafts maintain comfortable and safe speed once airborne, you will discover that your stress and energy levels will decrease once you've achieved momentum where you want to see it most. $\", \"^ Powerful emotions have been welling within you lately. You've found yourself struggling with more than one concern that has been draining to say the least. Now, you find yourself having to make a difficult decision and, particularly, how much you should or shouldn't reveal to someone else. Speak your mind and clear the air. This can only, and will be, a positive development. $\", '^ The current climate bodes extremely well where important discussions and short journeys are concerned but on an even more exciting level, it bodes extremely well where you being noticed by certain people whose opinions matter is concerned. An offer made now could appear too good to be true but you can trust it is genuine and that you deserve it! $', \"^ Square pegs will, with the right amount of force, fit into round holes. They won't fit perfectly but there can be no denying they have been made to occupy a space it was believed they couldn't fill. In a similar way, you are trying to force a situation. Resistance you're encountering is the result of trying to make to 'fit' something that is intended to accommodate something more appropriate. Stop applying force where it isn't needed and look for an easier solution. $\", '^ If you are in the process of buying or selling a property, take a deep breath. For something unforeseen could crop up in the next few weeks. This probably wont be irresolvable, but may extend the time it takes to get to completion. Business and personal loans may also be delayed or an application may need to be made elsewhere. Prepare yourself. $', \"^ If you start a new job, or contract, you will be more than likely to roll up your sleeves and show just how well you can apply yourself. The downside is, that the terms and conditions that you're offered may not be as clear as they should be. If you are set to work some while before being paid, ensure you will not end up out of pocket. $\", \"^ Very optimistic people say 'nothing's impossible'. We appreciate where they're coming from and admire how they refuse to believe that, if a thought can be conceived and believed in, it can't be achieved. However, we tend to also believe someone's deluding themselves if they think they really can achieve something we believe to be impossible. History is full of people who achieved the seemingly impossible. Don't be too quick to dismiss a certain idea as impossible now. $\", '^ Though you will be very eager and impatient to push forward with some important business, certain obstacles and delays will have to be accepted. It wont all be muddling, as the current tide of planetary patterns offers a basically favourable trend. Also, this is a helpful phase for dealing with creative ideas, messages and networking your aims. $', \"^ Somewhere in your world, it might be a case of 'once bitten, twice shy.' It might also be a case of refusing to invest more effort through having had something sap your energy and enthusiasm levels toward what once inspired and motivated you. Don't let an isolated incident cause you to throw in the proverbial towel. You're superbly placed to put a particular process in motion now but, for it to succeed, you'll need to be willing to see it from a new and inspiring perspective. $\", \"^ We've all been on the receiving end of criticism from those whom we have given much to and who create one almighty fuss when we cease giving. We're told we're insensitive, uncooperative and selfish from doing so. Yet, we know we're doing someone no favors by supporting them in a way that makes it difficult for them to take the initiative where it's needed. It might be time to assess how one-sided one arrangement in your world is becoming. $\", '^ This can be an expensive time of the year, but the fates could just give you a helping hand when you discover a cost is less expensive than you had first feared. And as soon as next week lucky Jupiter also enters your money zone where it will be until early June and then again from September to the years end. Unexpected fortune can be a feature of all of 2010. $', '^ Time to relax and enjoy being at home. Invite friends around, watch a movie and chill. You are keen to enjoy the simple pleasures of life - the smell of fresh coffee, the scent of flowers, blue sky or a walk in the country. Dont immediately rush to switch on the laptop or the TV  this is a day to connect with your surroundings and feel appreciation for them. $', \"^ You appear to believe yourself to be in a very volatile situation. That's understandable. What you've seen recently has been considerable change and need to adapt to new sets of circumstances and arrangements. This, in turn, has created an unmistakable feeling of insecurity. That's why it's important you recognize how recent dramas have little left within them to continue. What has altered has done so to make room for something better. Give it a chance to manifest. $\", \"^ A sense of urgency could arise, highlighting how time doesn't appear to be on your side in a way you wish it was. Before pressure manifests itself fully, take stock early on in the day to confirm which tasks can be pushed to one side to allow focus and effort for what truly deserves it. The more flexible you can be, the more your stress levels will be reduced. Resist any urge to be superhuman and try to tackle everything that comes your way. Being selective is conducive to being productive. $\", '^ Plaudits can come your way. Not perhaps exactly as you expect, but maybe you shouldnt be too fussy. If you usually shun the limelight, try to overcome your shyness. If you are more comfortable with this kind of attention, you can love every minute. Some kind of prize or award can recognize your achievements. If luck falls, enjoy every minute. You deserve it! $', '^ Your lover intends to take you away somewhere special. Get ready for an outing! The day gets better as it goes along especially as you give yourself a chance to unwind and enjoy the fun as it unfolds. If you are going past any shops there are ample opportunities to get some awesome bargains. Keep your eyes peeled. One item in particular is begging to be bought! $', \"^ There appears to be much demanding your time, attention and resources, not to mention individuals who believe your involvement or support means you now have an obligation to drop everything and placate them. Various factors are adding to pressure you're feeling already to fulfil particular responsibilities. Ensure you fulfil these your way and within timescales that suit you  because that's a plan that will suit everyone eventually.. $\", \"^ As someone born under the sign of the Water Bearer, yours is often confused with being a Water Sign. The imagery associated with Aquarius is 'someone who has returned from the fountain of knowledge to share with the rest of us what you've learned or discovered'. Someone now believes they have the upper hand where knowledge you seek is concerned. Be wary of their findings. $\", \"^ You could understandably view the way certain developments are unfolding in your world as luck. It wouldn't be inappropriate to believe you were in the right place at the right time to experience fortuitous developments like those the sky implies you're now benefiting from. Call it luck if you like but don't rule out how cared for and protected you are by the cosmos now. It's looking after you in ways you need and that's something you can truly trust. $\", \"^ A health matter can be a primary concern at this time. You might believe you're conveying a vibe of being fit as a fiddle or that all is hunky dory but those who truly know you know differently. The nurturing Cancer Full Moon affects self-improvement, your service to others and could make you appear more transparent than you believe yourself to be. Listen to what your mind, body, and soul tell you. Putting on a brave face or front fools only you. $\", \"^ Try not to succumb to a feeling or belief you're being too creative or innovative for your own good. Applying humdrum, tried-and-tested, predictable methodology doesn't inspire or motivate you as you feel an urge to explore options that aren't borne from comfort zones. With the right amount of confidence in your undertakings, you can attract the right kind of attention and support. $\", \"^ The saying about success coming more from who you know than what you know could be appropriate for you now. A friend or associate can provide a tidbit of information that gives you plenty to consider. Someone has their finger on the pulse in an area you wish you were more involved with. You're gaining 'inside knowledge' in a helpful and timely way. Now, it's up to you to apply it. $\", \"^ In some way, an easy option is on offer alongside a more challenging one. The easy option would be, of course, to take the easy option but you can hopefully sense that, by doing so, you'll bring about a half-baked result. Even then, there's no guarantee you won't end up having to take the more challenging option. So, now that we've established that you have a challenge that deserves rising to, have absolute faith in your ability to succeed or exceed an expectation by tackling it! $\", '^ Friends of old may come back into your life as you contemplate a reunion and catch up on the news. As Mercury is retrograde you may even find yourself back in touch with your ex or an old flame. The spirit of conviviality which is very strong at this time of year will help you to forget the problems of the past and to embrace the potential of the present. Anything is possible. $', '^ Whatever you are up to, its something you can love. You arent going to be spending much time alone either. You seem to be in demand with friends calling you for fun, a drink, emotional support and much more. There is also the promise of a reunion on the cards. This might be with an old flame, or an old school friend. Somethings in the air! $', '^ Perhaps some of your values have lost their luster and are in need of an update. If so, this would be a fine time to do just that. At the other end of the spectrum, if you are definitely ahead of the pack, your farsightedness could earn you a much desired improvement in cash flow. Yet dont be fearful of making a snap decision. Let your instincts guide you. $', \"^ We live in a world where 'control' is everywhere. Through use of technology, we control many aspects of our lives that we used to rely on others to manage. We have handsets for this and handsets for that. It's no wonder we feel a bit lost when we have to call upon for help from someone having exhausted all options in terms of making something happen ourselves. Don't be afraid or embarrassed to ask for help, particularly to gain - or regain - control of something. $\", \"^ It's easy to shrug our shoulders and say to ourselves 'ok, so at least I know where I stand'. We usually do this when we've invested time, faith and effort in the pursuit of something - or someone - and have reached limits that appear to dictate the need to accept defeat. You're not quite at that stage yet though, are you? The sky insists you're not and a delightful surprise awaits. $\", \"^ I recall watching, many years ago, TV game shows contestants discovered they'd won a lifetime supply of car wax. Perhaps believing the prize was better than winning no prize at all, they were accepting of their situation even if their disappointment at not having won the car of their dreams was evident. Then, the curtain would pull back to reveal they had won the car, too. In an area of your world, don't be too quick to accept defeat. The cosmos might just have a delightful surprise in store. $\", \"^ As children, we rarely ate food we didn't like. Even when adults adopted clever tactics to get us to do so, we found ways around their methods. Eventually, a truce of some kind got called. Adults accepted that it was frustrating and a waste of their time to make us do something that we were old enough to make our own decisions about. The same applies to you now. Someone is not averse to using forceful persuasion to get you to do something. You don't have to succumb. $\", \"^ Once again, we see you perfecting the ancient art of plate spinning. You've become quite good at this of late and plates appear to be symbolic of commitments and obligations you have to others that have probably increased dramatically during recent weeks. Can you take on much more? Should you take on any more? If you're not yet seeing evidence that pressure you've been under lately is subsiding, then you will soon. It's time to recognize your limits and then relax. $\", '^ Entering any realm of yesterday or yesteryear often involves darkness and a need to push aside cobwebs. You appear keen now to address an unresolved issue from your past. This is understandable as a matter of principle appears to be involved. It may not, however, be straightforward. The journey back in time you seem keen to make will not be without moments of tension so make it only if you truly believe you must. $', '^ Being the ultimate individual, you may prefer to link with others in an informal way, but sometimes, details and contracts count, be it romantically or commercially. Dont take short cuts with this kind of stuff now. You could forge a very good alliance but all the elements need to be firmly tied down, and clear. In love, home truths can be shared. $', \"^ Apparently, the word record for the most balls juggled is 11. Expert jugglers learned over time how to incorporate more than two items into their act. They likely started off mastering something at a basic level and progressed it when the time felt right to do so. Are we as skilled when it comes to responsibilities and obligations? As your responsibility increases in some way, accept you're not superhuman and limits exist in terms of what you can sensibly undertake or deliver. $\", '^ There is only one person you need to convince. This individual needs placating because others have given their input about something and seem to have done a good job with identifying and highlighting apparent flaws or issues with your plan. The person you need to convince is yourself. You have nothing to justify or explain. You simply need to keep faith levels high. Trust that there is no need to seek approval in ways you might believe there to be. $', \"^ We all wear 'masks' of some kind and can be a different person to different people. This doesn't make us phony or insincere. If anything, it reflects our ability to connect intuitively with others' and modify our actions or responses accordingly. Trust your instincts to help you to determine the right way to respond to or convey yourself to someone. It's possible they need to see a different 'you' than you usually present to them. $\", \"^ Remember the saying about counting chickens before they've hatched. As valid as your reason to feel optimistic about an aspect of your future might be, something needs to be assessed realistically. Although there can be no doubt you've built strong foundations in some way, be aware of how you might put too much pressure on yourself - or possibly others - to make something happen instantly. $\", \"^ Some doors don't open with ease. Doorknobs might need jiggling and some pushing or pulling might need to be involved and such strain is often required for doors that haven't been opened in some time! In an area of your world now, you might have to invest a bit more effort to open a proverbial door or at least get a glimpse into what further effort can bring. Whatever obstacle is preventing immediate access, with a bit of determination, you can overcome it. $\", \"^ Considering 'what might go wrong', even when we believe ourselves to be focused and optimistic, is an act of negativity. We inadvertently give negativity a chance to have its say and convince us that it does, in fact, have a valid point to make. Depending on how willing we are to absorb what it tells us determines how much of a problem we allow negativity to become. A plan needs positive focus now. It doesn't need negativity to influence it, even if you believe you're being sensible and practical. $\", \"^ The Sun motors into your opposite sign of Leo. This brings your relationships into focus, and if you've been enjoying a flirtatious time with one person, can help to concentrate your mind on whether you want something deeper and long lasting. If you're already in a tie, acknowledging your partners needs and viewpoint can be healing. $\", \"^ Changes doesn't always work in a 'domino-like' way. In other words, when we experience change in one way, it doesn't always mean we can expect a chain reaction of altered events because of it. When many things change, change often goes unnoticed. It's when one thing changes that the change is not only noticeable but permanent. The one, very noticeable change occurring now is not only helpful and necessary, it could, very soon, be seen as magical. $\", '^ Now that the talk and thought Mercury has turned direct, conversations of all kinds can become smoother. Today the bright ideas and fascinating discussions continue on, but with one major difference, you can now act upon those intuitive impulses and know that you have a better chance of a successful hassle-free outcome. Enjoy this liberation. $', \"^ Tension and pressure could emerge on the home or family fronts, but this might be due largely to others wanting your time, attention or advice. Although you might regard one domestic matter as not yours to resolve, you can still offer helpful guidance and support where either or both are needed. It's also possible you could feel a warm glow from feeling so appreciated and needed, if you're adopting a 'hands off' or detached stance where a certain issue is concerned. $\", \"^ Have you ever used a buffing machine? I'm talking about machines that shine floors. I used one once and nearly took out an entire row of units containing expensive jewelry. I was unaware of the need to gently steer the contraption rather than summon strength to control it and show it who's boss. I think you can see where this analogy is going. The more you relax and resist an urge to control a development that needs only to be steered gently, the better a result will be. $\", \"^ Long ago, kings and queens changed laws to suit them. If they wanted to do something and got told they couldn't, then they passed a law that declared they could but even kings and queens had to adhere to protocols. You have flexibility and power to change something that doesn't suit you. If you don't like a restriction in your world, then trust that you have the power to alter or remove it. You're being empowered to change something to suit you, and not before time. $\", \"^ Some people struggle to 'get to the point.' This could be due to umpteen different reasons but a main one can often involve seeing a situation in an unnecessarily complex way. They refuse to believe that a simpler and more straightforward option could actually be the best one. In an area of your world, try not to adhere to a belief that, if something appears to be too easy or obvious, then a catch exists. Accept that you're due a chance to seize an easy option for a change! $\", \"^ You might feel obliged to accept a situation as it is in the belief there's little you can do to alter it but the sky insists otherwise. You might also believe you have a responsibility to change someone's mind or gain their support for something they don't appear to be very supportive of. Must the onus be entirely on you to bring a particular change? With a tiny bit of persuasion, an obstacle  either a situation or a person  can be made to comply with your needs. $\", \"^ As babies, we have the equivalent of a blank DVD waiting for data to be indelibly burned on to it and it's searchable throughout our lifetimes. We aren't as choosy as we should be about what we allow to be included into our conscious and subconscious minds but, in our defense, we don't always have a choice about what finds its way into both. You do have a choice now to accept or dismiss something you're being told. The sky suggests it doesn't deserve to be accepted. $\", '^ Fortune can just seem to drop from nowhere. The best kind of luck, is when we least expect it. Some of what unfolds can be linked to your understanding of technology, fashion and trends. Just because you have been working quietly away, doesnt mean that your ideas are not gaining traction, because they are, and greater recognition is soon possible. $', '^ The rest of this month can be an incredibly busy time both socially and in terms of business connections. This period and the tie between Mercury and Mars in it can bring out the best of your personality, a time when you may be more go-getting than for many a Moon. You may also find yourself attending loads of functions, and having a ball! Your popularity rockets! $', \"^ Negativity loves company. It thrives upon knowing it has penetrated one barrier and have access to fresh, new areas and particularly enjoys being among groups of people. Company you keep now is important if you're to shake off a negative vibe you've created. If you think someone stands a chance of bringing you down, then avoid them. $\", \"^ Where a plan or pursuit close to your heart is concerned, you might have a bit of explaining to do. You might also need to work a bit harder than you thought you might in order to explain clearly your plan or vision. But wouldn't life be dull otherwise? Is there not something exciting about explaining what you see in a situation that certain others don't? You have a chance to shine in a way that allows others to see how imaginative and creative you can be. Step forward proudly. $\", '^ Some items we know to be fragile are sometimes more durable than we give them credit for. Others we know to be resilient can surprise us by how fragile they can be. So, we learn to handle each in ways we know to be most sensible. A similar approach is needed where a sensitive situation in your world is concerned. A fine balance between sensitivity and assertiveness is needed now. $', '^ You may experience a crisis of belief causing you to wonder whether you are coming or going. An event may encourage you to question your thinking. You may have thought you knew where you stood on all major issues, but suddenly everything you do know is thrown into jeopardy. A new idea may rock your boat, but it could also take you to an exciting new place. $', \"^ We tend to fear or even resent change when we experience it. Imagine how someone skilled at using an old fashioned typewriter felt when they discovered they had to learn how to use an electric one. Imagine how someone used to using an electric typewriter felt when they had to learn how to use a computer and software they've never heard of. When we have to, we adjust to change admirably even if a bit of time and a learning curve are required. Change you're experiencing now definitely has a learning curve of some kind attached but you need not fear it. $\", \"^ If others aren't aware of how you're the 'best person for the job' in a particular way, then it might be up to you to enlighten them. You can likely see a bigger picture and connect with what's required to make something happen in a particular way. Your 'way' might be seen as somewhat offbeat or unorthodox but you're blessed with strong powers of persuasion now. Use them in a calm and confident way to ensure your idea is accepted. $\", \"^ We can often catch people off guard in the nicest and delightful ways by responding in a way they didn't expect us to. This is often much more interesting if we respond in a heartfelt and loving way when they were expecting the opposite. It's very much within your ability now to touch someone's heart by responding in a way that's far removed from what they might be bracing themselves for. Be willing to make the effort to surprise them in such a way. $\", '^ You cant help but be excited by the promise of what is to come. Any challenges you face, pale into insignificance as you realize that you are now much closer to achieving your dreams than ever before. But there is one thing you can do to make life easier and potentially more successful; its to commit to living in the here and now, rather than in your memories. $', '^ One day, hopefully in our lifetimes, day trips to the Moon will be possible. Imagine sitting on the Moon, looking around you and looking down at the blue marble in the distance that is Earth. Imagine now, if you will, how serious or significant the issue occupying your thoughts now would appear. What is needed is perspective and faith, not worry or concern. $', \"^ Here you are, in what appears to be very familiar territory. It looks and feels familiar but is it? Despite how it looks, perhaps there are changes to what you're used to from the past? You could be forgiven for thinking you've returned to something or a situation that doesn't smack of being much different to how it was previously but, even through removing one or two obvious factors, it has. You're in a better, stronger and more knowledgeable position now, as you're about to see. $\", \"^ 'You can't do that'. 'Don't try'. 'Give up'. People say such words to each other regularly. They often do so to be helpful or in the belief they can see something about something someone else is keen to do that they themselves cannot. Sometimes, such advice is given based on previous experience, other times, it is instinctive. In any case, it's a shame so many listen to discouraging comments made by others. Think of what would be achieved if fewer people heeded such advice. Bear that in mind, too, where someone keen to discourage you is concerned. $\", \"^ Your stubborn side might not reveal itself often, but it could do so at this time. The Full Moon targets your home, family or domestic set-up, and encourages you to send out a reminder to others that you are in charge. However, those around you won't respond positively to demands. Gaining support and control where you want it will rely on handling at least one family member or a domestic matter with care. $\", \"^ Is a problem shared a problem halved or a problem doubled? Is it not fair to say that, when we absorb someone else's problem it then becomes our problem too? Many people believe this to be the case but if we all thought in such a way, then we'd never offer essential and helpful levels of support to those who need it. You could be inclined to believe you're making a rod for your own back through involving yourself with someone else's issue but gratitude you look set to receive from doing so might just make your efforts worthwhile. $\", \"^ How dull would life be if everything we did was easy? Imagine a life with no challenges and nothing that offered joy that accompanies accomplishment. There are times when we see a need to apply effort, patience or perseverance as signs that we're doing something wrong or are being dealt an unfair hand by an uncaring cosmos. Have faith in the fact that a tiny bit of difficulty you might be experiencing now is a sign that you are doing something very right! $\", '^ You are the star of the show, and keen to include others in your plans  a case of the more the merrier and the greater the opportunity to forge new connections and meet with those who share your outlook. There are plenty of fun times to be had whether you are in company or alone. What matters most is that you allow yourself to enjoy the day and all it has to offer. $', \"^ It might be helpful to review your expectations of a particular person. You might have clear in your mind what you want and need from them but might also be oblivious to how one-sided an arrangement is. If someone is willing to oblige you, then that offers temporary relief and the sky implies now that someone in your world isn't as happy with ways they're meeting your expectations as you believe them to be. Give them a chance to confirm what they want from you. $\", \"^ A fence must the most uncomfortable place in the world to sit upon. You undoubtedly have reasons for remaining non-committal about someone or something but in the same way your backside would be pleading for you to take action, the sky's doing the same now. Move toward achieving a result where there has little progress. It might not happen instantly but some level of success, if you can muster some energy and enthusiasm, is extremely likely now. $\", \"^ When we find ourselves faced with a seemingly locked or inaccessible door, we still rattle the doorknob in the hope it might open. In the absence of a key, we look for any other way that it can be opened, especially if we're determined to open it. In a metaphorical way, you hold a very special key that can remove what can only be described as a frustrating barrier in an area of your world. Sensitivity, compassion and kindness will work a minor miracle if you want them to. $\", '^ You can be one of the most generous and kindly members of the zodiac, and unpredictable with it too. For example, if someone demands a donation from you, you can be inclined to turn them down flat. Its when you make your own decisions that your spirit of giving can bubble out. And something that happens today can show exactly why this is. $', \"^ We all have our own list of priorities. Of course, our lists appear similar in many ways but it's your list that needs attention now. It might be time to assess how important what has been important really is now. Perhaps, it's time to determine how your time, efforts and talents can be put to better use. By looking closely what truly matters in your world, you're likely to identify a change that can and should be be made and one that will make a big and very positive difference. $\", \"^ When the cosmos decides it's necessary for us to be brought back to Earth to see a situation realistically or practically, then this tends to happen for a good reason. Being removed from a comfortable or colorful place can be on par with a cold shower, but there is something in your world you need to see more realistically now. Be grateful for what's occurring to help with this. A cold, sharp shock might be needed to spur you into action in a particular way. $\", \"^ Imagine if, when we find ourselves looking at an unwelcome development, we said 'here's a very interesting challenge, let's see what fun can be had with it.' If we said those words to ourselves each time we found ourselves staring into the face of adversity, we'd be amazed how much easier some problems would be to resolve. The sky doesn't speak of adversity coming your way but it does imply a challenge presenting itself. Summon some humor. See what happens. $\", \"^ We tend to think faster than we speak. At times, our words simply cannot keep up with our thoughts. There might be a good reason for this: so we learn to think twice before we speak. The sky suggests you are at risk now of either saying something you'll end up apologizing for or soon have to retract. You'd be well advised to think before you speak now. $\", '^ We dip our toe in bath water to check how hot it might be. We dip our toe in a swimming pool to determine how cold it might be. We apply hesitancy in so many other areas of our lives and as instinctive as this is in many ways, our need to so often stems from a lesson learned in the past. That could be playing a part in your reason for feeling hesitant in some way. The past is not always a helpful guideline for the future. You can afford to be less cautious now. $', \"^ If you were to make a point of carrying a sack of bricks with you everywhere you went, at some point someone would be appreciative of your forward-thinking. But what about other times? You'd be lumbered with a frustrating and pointless weight that you're carrying largely for others' benefit. You're about to abandon something that has weighed you down for too long. Prepare to experience joy and relief through not having to shoulder a particular burden anymore. $\", '^ As Saturn has recently moved back into one of your more sensitive zones, you may be reflecting on those areas of life that arent working as well for you as they might. This is a chance to get to the heart of the issue and begin a process of deep healing. The work you do on the inside will bring spectacular results on the outside. Dont miss this chance. $', \"^ You might feel as if you can't 'do right' for 'doing wrong' in more than one area of your world at this time. It might feel as if any effort you make results in you wishing you'd chosen a different approach or done nothing. However, doing nothing isn't an option, because your Aquarian attitude of 'the way must be tried' will put you in good stead if you apply it. The adage about not 'knowing' unless you 'try' is very relevant to you now. $\", \"^ One of the best ways to learn something is to make mistakes whilst learning it. Provided we genuinely want to learn something, we will, eventually, learn from what went wrong whilst trying to learn it! Recent weeks appear to have brought a steep learning curve of sorts for you. You've been under pressure to 'think on your feet' in some way and adjust to constantly changing circumstances. If it hasn't become clear how much you've learned, then it will become clear soon. $\", '^ If you are finding it hard to come to terms with personal and money challenges, it might be a good idea to play it by ear until a way ahead becomes clearer. By the end of the week, much of what occurs will begin to take a smoother course. All in all, this is a time when your proverbial detachment needs to be cultivated. Another corner will be turned. $', \"^ Sensing that momentum is working in your favor in some way could result in you taking a leap of faith into the unknown. This would probably be fine if it weren't for the fact that it could involve spending money unnecessarily or extravagantly. Look closely at what you're considering throwing money at. Will doing so really solve a problem or improve a situation? Connect with your ability to apply a more innovative and possibly more responsible solution. Money might not be the answer. $\", \"^ In Dr Seuss's 'Green Eggs and Ham', an unnamed character is pestered persistently by another to taste the proposed delicacy. After declining with every opportunity, the pursued character gives in and discovers he actually likes them. Don't be too quick to dismiss something you are certain you won't like or approve of. Give it a chance and you could be very surprised. It might be unfamiliar but that doesn't make it unsuitable or inappropriate. $\", '^ Consciously you may know what to do, and you probably have plans that you are busy putting into action. Unconsciously something quite different is going on, and it is this that may cause some angst. You may find that remembering your dreams or listening to your heart, gives you clues as to what to do and the answers may surprise you. $', \"^ We spend considerable time during our brief lifetimes looking for or wanting something that is much closer and within reach than we believed. This is usually due to us convincing ourselves that, if something really was accessible to us, we wouldn't need to invest time finding it. You can reduce much worry and frustration by looking a bit nearer than further afield for a solution now. You needn't invest time and effort searching for something immediately available to you. $\", \"^ It might feel as if your hand is forced in some way or you must accept a seemingly unacceptable situation. However, you might be overlooking how recent events have brought an improvement connected with the need to take action in a way you're hesitant to take now. Look closely at how you've been freed from one situation rather than focus on the restrictions and limitations you feel you must adhere to. A new opportunity is begging to be seized if you can spot it. $\", \"^ A brave step you've been considering appears to have much potential to bring a very pleasing and delightful result. It appears you have something to prove to yourself from doing so and taking the brave step you're considering could also remove a certain fear that has been problematic of late. Be aware also of how your actions or responses are being monitored - but in a way that is boosting your respect levels in the eyes of certain others. $\", \"^ You might have viewed a certain puzzling situation as something best left alone or unsolved. You're right to believe that digging further for a particular truth or with a view to uncovering more information would be enlightening, but you might be fearful of what you discover. However, being armed with vague or sparse information isn't helpful. You might need to step across a line you'd prefer to remain behind to do some detective work to find out more, but that will prove to be effort you'll be glad to have made. $\", \"^ Imagine one person demanding a 'yes' or 'no' answer from another. The person responds with 'under one condition'. The person demanding an answer grows increasingly frustrated and replies with 'no conditions, just a simple yes or no' to which the other responds 'well, it will have to be 'no' then'. The first person is likely to make an effort to continue the discussion! Don't be too rigid in a negotiation now and refuse to see the benefit to an 'under one condition' response. $\", \"^ You might feel you're in the best position to deal with a certain matter and ought to take the reins and control it. In truth, someone else could be keen to involve themselves and assist in ways you could be grateful for. That will require you to show a little bit more trust. This is a time when going off on a tangent on your own is unlikely to bring a result that teamwork will bring. $\", \"^ Whether it's an emotional clear-out or one involving bagging up unwanted items from the attic, it's time to detach yourself from something connected with the past. If it's an item you refused previously to part with for sentimental reasons, then you could be about to update or upgrade it. If it's a memory, then accepting you no longer need to seek security or comfort from it is a clear sign you've progressed. $\", \"^ You have your idea how something should be done or a certain situation should be handled or managed. Is it any surprise that someone believes their way is best? Clearly, they are unable to see what you see in what's unfolding and requiring effort in a particular way. Don't succumb to pressure to placate them in the way they believe you should. This is a time to stick to your guns and refuse to deviate from a very carefully considered plan. $\", \"^ We can all have a tendency to 'fight fire with fire' or combat one set of negative circumstances by responding or reacting similarly. We don't need to have experiencing in firefighting to know such an act results only in increasing the size and strength of an inferno. As tempted as you might be to 'give as good as you get' in some way, consider how unhelpful that will be. A far better result can come from trusting what you know to be a more considerate or sensitive approach. $\", '^ If you have a big decision to make, dont be wary of seeking advice. Sometimes you can recoil against professional people, having a natural tendency to buck convention. Just remember plenty of Water Carriers work in these areas too. Then again, someone may seek your assistance. A contract can be mooted and it can be important to your future. $', '^ New faces and new introductions made at this time could have far-reaching implications. You never know who you might be introduced to and one new connection could become a long-lasting and solid friendship. Be willing to make yourself known to others and make an effort to go beyond superficial chitchat. $', \"^ Regardless of how certain you feel everything will unfold exactly as planned in some way, you'd be wise to have a contingency plan or two ready. If a plan goes awry, then look for the opportunity concealed within the disruption. An unexpected twist or turn could end up being something you're grateful for, especially if it highlights a more effective strategy that you can apply. $\", \"^ It could be easy to look at a situation or arrangement and believe it falls short of what you wish it was. Certain restrictions are hampering progress and might appear to be beyond your ability to alter or hasten. However, within all that might appear negative, there appears to be something worthy of appreciating. Something encouraging can be found within what appears discouraging. That's what needs your focus and effort now. The more of both you apply, the easier it will be to uncover the golden nugget of positivity. $\", \"^ You're not someone who gets possessive, jealous and controlling, right? Well, that may be your general goal, and good for you if you have one, but you are flesh and blood, and sometimes the general human condition will affect even the most principled of Water Carriers. Yet today you might perceive that someone is inflicting these on you. $\", \"^ Current aspects could be playing a part in inconsistent or erratic behavior on your part and you might be aware of uncharacteristic responses you're making toward certain situations and you can be certain others do, too. Try to be receptive and accommodating to anyone who feels a need exists to question how or why you're reacting or responding as you are. At least one person wants to be supportive and help take pressure off of you in some way. $\", '^ Has an unseen, supreme force deliberately overlooked you when distributing happiness and luck? It might be easy to look around your world and believe that others are benefiting from fortuitous situations whilst you are made to keep your nose to a tedious grindstone. Very shortly, you will have something to smile about. This will then become something to extremely glad of. $', \"^ We react in one way to some situations one day and react completely differently to the same scenarios the next. Of course, much depends on numerous factors and our attitude at the time. Although you might be unable to change a certain situation, you do have a say regarding how you approach it. If you're not yet spotting the opportunity contained within what might appear daunting or uninspiring, then look a bit more closely. $\", \"^ Have you ever read a contract that made interesting or fascinating reading? They're written in ways that deliberately cause anyone to give up reading them in a short space of time for more than one reason. Try to bear that in mind as you convey what might be an idea or plan that leaves others wondering what you're on about rather than inspiring or motivating them. Keep it simple and to the point. $\", '^ Despite recent tough and tumbles, including mixed emotions triggered by sudden events and pressures, this is a time to seek a happier outlook. By the end of this hard tasks week, the Moons move into your own sign will urge you to reassess and strengthen your future plans. There will be plenty of useful and creative adventures to explore. $', '^ Financial considerations remain to the fore. Someone could be pressing you to change your approach to spending or you pressing them to change theirs. With Uranus active in the part of your solar horoscope governing everyday costs, and joined by the Moon, you could feel a bit impulsive. Might there even be a tendency to spend cash to make a rebellious point? $', \"^ To determine who has won a race difficult to confirm with the human eye, a camera usually leaves little doubt as to who crossed the finish line first. It's important to understand that, despite how narrow your achieving a success recently was, it was still a success that is yours. Don't dwell on how differently you feel you would have done something. You have achieved something special. $\", \"^ Your new calling could be calling - and a change in your career could be a distinct possibility. However, what you're granted now is a chance to become clear about what motivates or inspires you to get up in the morning and give your all. It could be helpful to contact somebody doing something you wish you were doing, career-wise. They could offer helpful and timely advice, or give you a quick peek at their contacts list. $\", \"^ There's always excitement and tension as a thunderstorm brews. This causes people to peer outside with mixtures of fear and fervor. As dark as the day gets as the storm draws closer, we know, deep inside, we're unlikely to witness anything worse than we've seen before. Don't be in any way afraid of what appears to be a storm looming in your world. Wind and darkness preceding it will prove to be scarier than the storm itself. $\", \"^ People gravitate towards negativity. We encounter it when we make light conversation at bus stops about the weather or have to deal with customer service people. People will, more often than not, focus on what's negative or what they believe can't be done. You can do much now to influence people in a positive way. You can, if you wish, bring optimism to an otherwise gloomy scenario. If you decide to lead, others are likely to follow. $\", \"^ What might have had you fired up recently could shift further down your priority list. However, it's important to acknowledge that you're not abandoning an idea or plan but choosing to divert your energy in a new and more appropriate direction. Returning to it in the future with a clearer mind and fresh perspective could be a sensible option. $\", \"^ You can find yourself interacting with people of a different age group to yours. You often have a gift with younger citizens because, generally, you're not preachy, nor do you try too hard to get along with them. This can be appreciated about you today. However, a sensitive subject may need discussing and you may be dreading it. $\", \"^ Some leaders are unaware of closely they're watched and followed by others. This can be both positive and negative. As experienced as someone might be as a leader, it doesn't automatically mean they always set a positive example. This might be something you can see in an area of your world now. You have a chance to lead if you're willing to accept the challenge. More than one person might hope you rise to it, too. $\", \"^ Second best is always an option. Some people are happy to settle for it because they adhere to the 'aim high and the worst case scenario is you'll come in second instead of first'. It's important you believe that you need not settle for second best in an area you'd prefer and deserve to come in higher. You are up against competition of sorts but don't let that deter you! $\", \"^ There could be a noticeable streak of stubbornness attached to something that inspires you creatively. For many Aquarians, this might relate to a change occurring within the home, but regardless of where your unique brand of creativity is focused, others will be in no doubt that something must be done your way. Try not to assume they understand instantly what you're trying to accomplish. Let your actions prove that you know what you're doing. $\", \"^ Big things rarely trip us up. We tend to trip over the smaller or at times, invisible things, not what's staring us in the face or immediately apparent or obvious. That's why it pays to give attention to detail and, in an area of your world now, it's detail you ought to be focused on. As big, daunting or intimidating an issue might appear, it is the detail contained within it that is not only making it appear bigger but where your attention should be focused. Deal with what makes up the issue and you stand to reduce it significantly and swiftly. $\", \"^ Looking at a particular situation in one way gives apparent cause to feel concern. Looking at it from another angle with just a small amount of imagination applied, can offer something to feel optimistic about. It's the way you're viewing a seemingly unsatisfactory situation that is causing you to miss the opportunity contained within. Applying a bit of imagination can reveal something delightful. $\", \"^ Back in the days of silent movies, the dastardly, moustache-twirling villain would have risked life and limb if he ever appeared in person from behind the cinema curtain. People believed him to be the nastiest person to have ever walked the planet. The fact that he was a character in a grainy, silent film meant nothing. Be very careful about judgment you're making about a certain person now. The does suggest you could be very wrong. $\", \"^ Negative people are delighted when their negative thoughts and opinions are agreed with or confirmed. They often resent feeling negative about something alone and therefore need to know they're not alone with their pessimistic outlook. Where a certain negative individual is concerned, try to avoid getting caught up in their gloomy world. They'd love you to be part of it. $\", \"^ Many people believe there are only leaders and followers in this world and each of us is either one or the other. Obviously, it's not quite as straightforward as that. Each of us is both a leader and follower depending on circumstances at any given time. You appear to be constantly playing a subservient role to someone with a domineering personality. They believe you will always be a follower and are happy with that arrangement. You do have the ability to balance things now. $\", \"^ It's time to assess your reasons for pursuing a particular plan. Are you acting out of need or obligation? Or is what you're doing being done out of love and inspiration? If it's the former, then that would explain any resentment attached. If, however, your reasons stem from the latter, then some form of personal fulfilment is assured, and very soon. $\", \"^ Your quest for adventure could intensify, pushing you to consider exploring new territory. Even if a physical journey isn't possible, there are ways you can immerse yourself in a world of discovery with the click of a mouse or a good book. Succumb to any urge to learn or explore the world beyond your immediate surroundings. Something revealing can result from doing so. $\", \"^ Some people love to perpetuate discussions, even arguments. They do so because they want recognition of some part they played in a process or situation. They often believe this has been overlooked and therefore try unsubtly to attain recognition they believe they're owed. Someone you know is demanding attention now. By all means, give it but only in measured doses. $\", \"^ There's part of you that will always be a bit of an outsider. In fact, the thought of being friendly to someone because you might gain from it can go right against your grain. But there is also a time to be dignified and show good grace and if you do interact with someone important now - dont see this as being beneath you. If you do, you may be seen as standoffish. $\", \"^ Is it a case of 'back to the drawing board' now? I suspect you're of the opinion that you've no option but to go back to Square One where a plan close to your heart is concerned. We tend to do this in the belief that similar if not longer lengths of time will be required to get us back to a point when we were optimistic. You won't be waiting nearly as long as that this time. $\", \"^ Sometimes, we have to accept someone else is right about something important to us. Input from an external source can be very helpful if we've allowed ourselves to get too close to a situation. It might not be easy for you to accept you were wrong in some way but you can do much now to strengthen a bond or alliance by showing willingness to agree with what someone is telling you. $\", \"^ What's the rush? Where is urgency coming from? Perhaps, you don't see anywhere in your world where urgency is taking precedence. Maybe, you don't feel particularly anxious about where particular progress needs to be made. Maybe, that's the situation now. It's likely that, very soon, you will believe something to be more time sensitive than it appears currently. When that happens, remember that slow and steady really will win a particular race. Take it easy and slowly. $\", \"^ Are you aware of influence you hold where a situation involving someone close to you is concerned? Are you aware of how you are capable of transforming an undesirable situation into a positive and enriching one? If you were aware of power you hold, then you'd undoubtedly be using it. Look closely at where you really can make a very positive difference now. $\", \"^ It's interesting how much easier it is to lose our tempers with those closest to us, isn't it? Our loved ones invariably bear the brunt of our frustrations and you appear at risk of parting the hair of someone close to you with a few chosen words. They don't need the hassle and neither do you. Bite your tongue if you can and apply sensitivity where you know it's needed. $\", \"^ You might perceive a certain rule or enforced restriction as something to rebel against, believing it has no relevance whatsoever to you. Try to connect with how it's encouraging you to think and become more familiar with your 'place' in a greater scheme of things. If you look at a situation objectively, you'll see how you can still enjoy a certain freedom without having to adhere to a rule you regard as daft. $\", '^ You can find yourself pulled in several directions. After a highly busy phase around work, commitments and responsibilities, you may find yourself wanting to catch up with friends on the news or for some light hearted banter. Breaking away from these demands or even satisfying the attentions of loved ones may see you having to don your jugglers costume. $', \"^ One consistent theme to many astrological signs at this time has to do with removal from Comfort Zones. Upheaval you face now surrounds what you want or don't want from one particular close relationship. Oh dear, that did sound a bit ominous and harsh, didn't it? Don't be concerned about your removal from a 'relationship rut' you find yourself in. You will soon be very glad and appreciative of the change. $\", \"^ If you're aware of drains on your energy, then you have a chance to address and resolve these now. It's also important that you don't underestimate how you can bring light to those in your world who could use some cheer or a frown turned upside down. Simply be yourself and available for them. Your strength of character can be nothing short of inspirational if you connect with others generously. $\", \"^ It will be nice to shift your focus from a serious matter that has possibly drained your energy levels to something upbeat and much more stimulating. Your insight into a particular topic could make you excellent company in the eyes of others, so imparting knowledge is not only something you do best but can be a perfect distraction from what has been receiving the lion's share of focus recently. $\", \"^ Situations requiring urgent action often create unnecessary pressure. Something that didn't seem urgent suddenly appears and demands as much attention as they can get from us. Isn't it interesting though that what seems urgent doesn't last as long as we thought it would? Either we resolve what needed resolved swiftly or we find a way to relax that allows us to think more clearly and devise a sensible plan. If you can ignore urgency now, then you too can do the latter. $\", '^ Someone influential is going to be watching how you handle an important matter today. Because you have a love of the new and the progressive, sometimes traditional methods can seem dated to you, even if your personal attitudes dont easily shift. Yet you may be better off sticking to convention today, and conforming to exactly what this person wants. $', \"^ He who hesitates, we are told, is lost. That's a bit unfair in some ways. Just because someone sees a need to weigh up properly a situation doesn't make them 'lost'. It often makes them sensible and practical. But, to give credit to the old saying, there are times when it's counterproductive to wait too long. The sky's message to you now is: don't wait too long 'playing it safe'. An opportunity won't hang around forever. $\", \"^ We resent distractions and obstacles to our plans but how many are our creation? We can all, inadvertently or deliberately, be barriers to success through creating those that delay progress and hinder success. The biggest and most powerful barriers are those constructed with the help of negativity and pessimism. If you can focus attention on anything other than either or both, then you'll be removing bricks from a barrier that will soon crumble. $\", \"^ Our heads have a tendency to weigh up the cold and harsh facts. Our hearts tend to adopt a much more finely-tuned, innate approach. Somewhere in your world exists a need to push aside facts. As essential as these are in making a decision, they are causing you to disregard the benefits of looking at something from an emotional point of view. Put yourself in someone else' shoes, even briefly and you'll see a way forward that involves being loving and forgiving. $\", \"^ When we constantly prime ourselves for certain situations or scenarios, we soon start to see everything or everyone as a potential threat in some way. When we're in the throes of having to deal with certain issues, the very last thing we need is to have to deal with more confrontation from someone oblivious to what we're already dealing with. Don't misinterpret a request being made of you as something to defend yourself against. It holds an answer you need. $\", \"^ There is, what I can only describe as, a bullying influence in your world now. Does someone genuinely believe you will simply succumb to their demands? This intimidating influence won't last; in fact, soon you'll see that what currently concerns you is little more than a storm in a teacup. Relax. All will be fine. $\", \"^ Focus could soon be put on money matters, particularly what you earn or how your attitude toward all things material convey to others how you want to be seen by them. A shaking of financial foundations can occur but it's important you see what transpires in this sense as a way and need to rebuild a financial footing in a firmer and possibly more realistic way. This includes a likely need to re-prioritize your outgoings through a long-overdue truth being revealed. $\", \"^ Let's talk about 'self-respect'. Everyone possesses it on varying levels. Self-respect permeates every area of our respective existences. The trouble is, some people have so much for their superiors that they end up with little left for themselves. Be careful of whom you deem worthy of your respect now. You could be inclined to offer a bit too much to the wrong person or people and not leave enough for one person who really deserves it  you! $\", \"^ 'Like' often attracts 'like'. We often underestimate how influential we are in terms of affecting outcomes. Just a mere change of attitude can cause us from being an 'unlike' to a 'like' and then  suddenly  we find ourselves delighted with progress we're making. In an area of your life, there is a need to adopt a change in attitude. Try championing a cause from another angle. $\", '^ Thrusting Mars will soon arrive to transform the whole landscape of your situation. The last four weeks has found you analytical, questioning, even doubtful. And all this can make for a powerful next ten days, but not necessarily a very outgoing time. That is of course, until Mars starts to power up your system, and help you to feel far different and stronger. $', \"^ 'What's in it for me?' All too often, this question gets asked by those who want to know how an action or support on their part will be reciprocated or rewarded. It's too much for some people to simply agree to help or be supportive in any way without being concerned with how they'll benefit from doing so. It's interesting how so much in your world could change in a glorious way if you continue to be willing to help or be supportive whilst requesting nothing in return. You'll see. $\", \"^ We all know that sometimes, to be taken seriously, actions must reinforce our words. We can talk until proverbial cows come home but being seen to make an effort to make something happen confirms our faith and dedication levels. For you to make progress in a particular way might require the support of certain others. You might have 'talked the talk.' Now, it's time to 'walk the walk.' $\", \"^ Where others might find chaos and upheaval too much to deal with, you can find ways to thrive within either or both and this ability could be helpful now. You can see logic and structure within what others might be seeing as chaotic and structureless. You're able to bring stability that helps not only you but others who might be prone to err on the side of pessimism. $\", \"^ You appear to have reached a point of no return in an area of your world. Recent decisions have moved you forward in a way that means there's no going back but that probably offers more in the way of celebration than it does consolation. There's still some level of adjustment on your part required but a reassuring glimpse into your new, chosen future will soon aid with that. $\", \"^ We resent having restriction forced upon us. We find ourselves in situations that we wish we had more freedom within that are governed by someone else dictating what we can or can't do. There are times when we have no option other than to comply, regardless of how much doing so might not suit us. Where you are aware you've been dictated to in such a way, smile and go along with someone's demand. Soon, you'll see how doing so allows you to gain an advantage. $\", \"^ A tense situation that has preoccupied your mind for some time appears to be waning. You have had your share of confrontation and concern. Although the noise has died down and you're able to focus on repairing or possibly rebuilding something relating to your reputation or how you're  seen by certain others, you have a fantastic contribution to make in another area. Someone has their eye on you and has something they want to ask you! $\", '^ Many people are preoccupied with what others own. They watch them closely, to gauge the level of comfort in their worlds and how much happier they are or appear to beThe sky suggests though that you might be overlooking numerous ways in which you could boost your happiness levels with just a tiny bit of imagination and effort. $', \"^ Many hands, we are told, make light work yet, when many hands become involved, so too do many opinions. Suddenly, others see a need to provide unhelpful input or cast negative judgment and you could soon be seeing evidence of a need to defend yourself against certain people who believe they're right to criticize you in some way. You know, in your heart, what is right and makes sense. Trust that, in time, others who can't see or feel what you feel will do so before long. $\", '^ Is there a time when we should be grateful or appreciative of restriction that exists in our worlds? Bungee jumpers would agree with that question. Restriction, when it prevents us from going further in any way in a necessary way is always helpful if not essential. So, with that in mind, look a bit more closely at where restriction exists in your world and then look at how it might actually be holding you back  temporarily - for a very good reason. $', \"^ You might find the idea of multitasking to be appealing but be careful you don't scatter your energy in an unfocused way. You're right to be discerning about tasks you commit to because you could be at risk of overdoing what you focus your attention on. Knowing when something is done and the time is right to step away from it and declare it finished is your mission now. This is a time when going above the call of duty doesn't do you or anyone else any favors. $\", '^ We rely so much on others interpreting correctly what we try to say. Our increasing technological age makes this even more difficult. A sentence sent electronically could appear very differently to how it was intended or how it would be interpreted had words been said instead of sent. If there is something you want to make clear, opt for the old fashioned, face-to-face method! Avoid any tendency to rely on conveying an important point in any other way now. $', '^ A quick flick through a book or a website may hold the answer to a dilemma. Someone somewhere has the information you need. This is the time to take a good look at your health and think about how you can improve matters. Do you need to lose weight? Are you keen to get back into shape? Whatever your issue take control by making a start. $', \"^ How 'right' does something feel? If you think back to recent months of uncertainty you've experienced, then you're likely to be feeling in a much better place now. An arrangement or agreement is imminent and this has significant implications to your comfort in terms of your domestic set-up, with whom you share it and your material world. Let it unfold on its own. It might be taking longer than you wished but a process is moving forward. $\", \"^ When Dorothy arrived in Oz, she was bewildered by what she saw. It was clear to her she had arrived in a magical place that, at first, didn't hint in the slightest way that she had reason to feel apprehensive or defensive. She was in unfamiliar territory, that much was clear but its magical qualities were unignorable. Where you are now entering unfamiliar territory in some way, focus on what is truly magical about it and not what you believe gives reason to be suspicious or cautious. $\", '^ So much of your situation is absolutely buzzing with vibrancy and truly there can be plenty of mirth filled fun. However, something deeper is also stirred, and this can relate to your love life. This may see a tie which has fully run its course, finally come to a close, but equally it could see a growing if for now, secret fascination, with one new mysterious face. $', \"^ You could surprise more than one person by how you choose to react to a certain situation. Where one or two others might have believed you'd react aggressively or defensively, you could show them how powerful reacting in completely opposite ways can be. If you find yourself close to losing your cool in any situation, count to ten and deal with it rationally and calmly. Chances are, you're being watched by at least one person who will admire you for doing so. $\", \"^ Our emotions often require managing and we tend to be very aware of how, unless we control them, they will control us. That's why it's always advisable to wait some time before sending a strong or nasty email or text. That's why we should allow ourselves to cool down before confronting someone about something. If you feel yourself moving toward making a decision based on your emotional response to it, then count to ten before saying or doing anything. $\", \"^ A positive outcome to a situation where you believed it necessary to expect a negative result is likely. As much as it might appear unlikely that you stood any chance of being pleased or delighted, try to accept how much celestial assistance is on offer to you now. This will become clearer or more obvious when an obstacle you've convinced yourself will be problematic reveals itself to be one you can overcome with ease. $\", \"^ Someone else's behavior might be confusing and possibly even downright annoying. You might be able to identify what's causing them to behave in such a way but had probably hoped they'd have refrained from making an issue out of something you believed didn't warrant it. They're not looking for an apology from you. They're looking for support and understanding that you're well-placed to provide. Offer both and you'll see an almost immediate change in their reaction. $\", '^ You are generally an independent soul Aquarius and may not like it if people around you want to call you to account. But there could be a misunderstanding behind this, and Venus is urging you to remain cool, calm and collected, which is good, because if you are, an issue can soon fade away. In fact, the next few weeks can be special romantically. $', \"^ In order to move forward now, you must let something go. In the same way a hiker carrying a heavy backpack discards a few dispensable items to lighten their load, you must shed something weighty that you've been carrying for too long. This could involve abandoning at least one set-in-stone preconception that is no longer appropriate. Lose it and you will gain in many ways. $\", \"^ Habits are, as they say, habit forming. But 'they' probably aren't going through the change you have instigated or have forgotten how frustrating change can be. Something in your world is in need of changing. You need to abandon something no longer needed. You won't miss it as much as you think. $\", \"^ You might feel obliged to 'live up' to someone's slightly inflated expectations. However, you might not be seeing these accurately, because it's possible they have more faith in your abilities in a particular way than you do. Try to connect with what's familiar about the need to rise to a challenge presenting itself now. What someone expects from you is probably based on what you made happen previously. $\", '^ You could find yourself in the mood for some culture. Now, whether this is popular or high brow it matters not a jot, but a welcome break from the humdrum can give you a surge of enthusiasm. It can also help to open your perspective to wider vistas, and see how other people think and feel about things. Why not try eating something different too? $', '^ Your curiosity will know few bounds this weekend. If you are someone with a natural appreciation and interest in esoteric subjects, delving deeper can throw up lots of exciting and interesting facts. Then again, you could be with a very jolly group and be perfectly content to take a step back. You may well find yourself earnestly people watching. $', '^ Should you stay or should you go? Such words from a well-known eighties song are appropriate for you now. Something or someone in your world demands a certain level of commitment. You can identify reasons why you ought to give it but can also identify reasons why stepping back  or, dare I say it, walking away  are as appropriate. Help you need with this decision is coming. You can remain committed but a new agreement will need to be reached in some way. $', \"^ A 'horse to water' syndrome might be occurring in an area of your world. In other words, you might be wondering why you have to go to considerable effort to persuade someone of something they shouldn't need persuading about. A process needs to be shared or at least work in more of a balanced way than it is currently. This can happen but be prepared to have to work a bit harder for a bit longer to sell someone on the idea you wish they'd simply accept and support. $\", \"^ With change, comes upheaval. With upheaval, comes insecurity. Insecurity we feel doesn't last long but it does tend to make its presence felt strongly when we are experiencing it. You're aware of change that has occurred in your world of late and how you're having to adjust to a new situation or set of circumstances. This is, in turn, bringing with it insecurity. Soon, you can expect to feel more comfortable and confident about what you're having to adjust to. $\", '^ The Quarter Moon occurs in your sign, and faces the stormy Mars, but Squares the Sun. This is not an easy combination, and particularly when it comes to your personal desires. Demands can be made on you and forcibly, particularly at home. Then again, health or lifestyle restrictions, your own or those of someone you like, can make things difficult. $', \"^ Your desire to have your say is going to get greater and greater. Even amongst friends you can become more outspoken. Really? Yes, even more! The trick is going to be to know which situations to fight your corner over, and which to walk by. If not, you may find yourself getting caught up in disputes, rather too much. But you're vibrant, for sure. $\", '^ You can remain aloof from the family. Your friends often provide the greatest solace in your life, even if you basically love your folks. If there are differences in your approach and those of your siblings, they can come sharply into focus. This doesnt mean that there will be a tiff, but perhaps you or they will just prefer to keep a healthy distance in place. $', \"^ We know there's always a 'bigger picture' behind most situations. It's easy to overlook that though, especially when all we see is what's happening here and now. Someone telling us to be more hopeful or optimistic through is like telling someone hungry that, at some point soon, they'll enjoy a lovely, cooked meal. What you believe you need now forms part of a much bigger and more hopeful picture. It's important to see how small but integral what's happening now really is. $\", \"^ Have you considered that you don't need to persuade someone as much you think to get your way? Or that what you want to see happen might happen own without intervention from you? If you have, then good. You've spotted how to eliminate a huge amount of stress from your world. Soon, you'll see evidence that a process can be left to unfold in its own way and time. $\", \"^ 'Out with the old, in with the new'. It doesn't take long to grow used to new situations. Despite fearing and dreading time and effort we expect will be required to embrace upheaval, we tend to find our new situation doesn't feel quite so new after a short space of time. You appear to be getting used to a new situation that has replaced a much more established one. Don't reflect on how long it took you to get used to the predecessor. You'll soon grow to love the successor. $\", '^ Health and wellbeing are in focus. You may want to indulge your tastes after a period of time in which you have been exceptionally well disciplined. Venus in Cancer suggests a desire for comfort foods and for something to make you feel better and life more enjoyable. However, there may be another more healthy way to achieve this. $', \"^ If we tell ourselves something enough times, then we eventually convince ourselves of its truth. We are capable of inducing a sort of self-hypnosis through investing absolute faith in something we were dubious of to begin with. Can the same be said about opinions and advice coming our way from others? Do others really have the ability to alter our belief by telling us the same thing over and over again? It's possible. Don't allow others to alter a certain belief of yours now. $\", \"^ There could be something intriguing, exciting and reassuring about a chance to put your unique spin or stamp on something. If you're typical of your sign and tend to disregard tedious or traditional ways of doing or pursuing anything, then this could be a time when you welcome a chance to ignore certain rules and do something your way. Someone could be keen to follow your lead, too. $\", \"^ Aquarius is said to be the zodiac sign concerned with higher truths. So, that means that you never tell the odd white fib then? Absolutely not, we're all mortal. But over the next three years, remain conscious of the role of your co-regent, Saturn, because if you do try to take short cuts, or get involved in dodgy deals or contracts, it can come back on you. $\", \"^ The idea of pursuing something on your own rather than involving others might appeal to you but if doing so means you have to shelve an idea to take leadership in some way, then time on your own could be time well spent. There might be something you need to gain a better understanding of before you can involve others and that's something the cosmos is assisting with now. $\", \"^ Wanting a plan to unfold more quickly than it's able to could be a source of frustration, especially if you're relying on one or two others to do what they must do to move it along. However, you could end up being grateful for the time available to you that helps you look further down the road at what you'll need to prepare for next. If you have time to kill before something can proceed, then you could experience a brainwave that helps you pass the time more productively. $\", \"^ There are people in this world who want us to agree with them. They want no resistance from us because it makes their life a bit harder. They believe that, as long as we do as they tell us, all will be fine. Sometimes though, these people discover that they must deal with opposition and resistance. Someone who thinks you were an easy target is about to discover otherwise. You don't need to adopt an aggressive stance, just a firm and fair one. $\", '^ If you are interested in personal development courses and workshops, or alternative medicine, the next six months can be a time of great discovery. There may be someone who will act as a life guide, perhaps you will have formal one to one sessions. If you work in any of the above areas, business can pick up. If you would like to train, explore colleges. $', \"^ Even in the most luxurious hotels, people find reason to complain. Despite effort made to ensure any customer's stay is as comfortable as possible in every respect, some people are unhappy. They say 'that wasn't right' or 'this could've been better'. Of course, some might have genuine reason to complain but might you be finding fault within something that really could be seen as better than you're giving it credit for? Focus on what is enjoyable - and worthy of appreciation! $\", \"^ Before we pursue a plan or commit to something, we do a quick mental assessment of whether or not we're doing is the 'right' thing. We tend to be pretty skilled at assessing implications of what we're considering. Usually, we make accurate assessments and are able to gauge what level of controversy exists surrounding what we're planning to do. Don't be concerned about whether or not you are doing the 'right' thing now. It feels 'right' and therefore, it is 'right'. $\", \"^ Everyone has experienced speaking hastily but it's hard to take something back which has caused offence, even if a sincere apology is then offered. Because you have a rebellious and sometimes argumentative side to your nature, you can intensely dislike being told what to do, and react. But walking away from a dispute can be the smart thing to do now. $\", \"^ Nothing annoys a comedian more than telling a well-rehearsed joke to an audience and receiving little or no response. You're probably wondering now where you went wrong conveying an idea to someone you were certain would immediately grasp a concept. You haven't failed. With a bit more effort and some carefully chosen words, you can still win them over. $\", \"^ What do humans and hammers have in common? They both lose their heads when they fly off the handle. Escaping a confrontational situation now may prove difficult but you have infinitely more power than you think about how 'over the top' this becomes. Don't rise to bait in the way someone hopes you will. If you really want to diffuse a tense scenario, remember that anger and intolerance are enemies of understanding. Be cool and keep your cool. $\", \"^ Is that it? Is something finished, done and dusted, finito? Where you might believe a less than satisfactory result achieved in the past might be very set in stone, you could be surprised at how much life and flexibility are actually left in it. It's also possible you could be pleasantly surprised at how helpful a seemingly unhelpful development in the past is about to become. Be prepared now to not only look at something a second time but to give it a second chance. $\", \"^ A review of a plan or strategy is needed and this could alter a few ideas you believed to be solid and not in need of assessing. What you believed to be cut and dried, signed, sorted or delivered could now be something you're having to reconsider in more ways than one. Will this prove helpful? Absolutely! It's happening for a reason and as you identify a better option worth pursuing in some way, that reason will become even clearer soon. $\", \"^ Human beings are very 'accepting' creatures. We take a great deal at face value until we have reason to believe otherwise. Somewhere in your world, you're expected to be accepting of a situation that doesn't sit particularly well with you. It's as if someone else has the upper hand or greater control. You don't want control, you want balance and that's what's coming. $\", \"^ When 'they' say 'he who hesitates is lost', what do 'they 'mean? The person hesitating has found themselves in unfamiliar surroundings?  We understand the proverb to mean people should act decisively or anyone unable to reach a decision will pay a price in some way for being so. So, there must be a fine line between hesitating sensibly and hesitating counterproductively. Where you feel hesitancy, trust that it exists for a helpful reason. An important decision relies on it. $\", '^ You might have enjoyed or felt comfortable with watching a situation from the sidelines. However, a need exists for you to contribute knowledge, skills, experience or wisdom and possibly in more than one way. Try to see the benefits of collaborating and cooperating. You can benefit from a shared effort, but will need to knuckle down and get your hands dirty with others! $', \"^ It's interesting how we prefer predictability to volatility. We know what we like and like what we know. We also have our reasons for opting for what is tried, tested or familiar. But, you are ruled by Uranus, the planet that governs unpredictability among many other things. The planet of surprise intends to help you now by shaking up something that has become a bit too settled! $\", \"^ We can often sense, almost in Spider-Man style, trouble ahead. But what about magic? Can we detect that similarly? Of course, we can. We just need to trust what we feel and push aside pessimism and negativity determined to work together to drown out the signal. Make a concerted effort to banish both now. If you can, then you'll be allowing something magical to reveal itself. $\", \"^ Don't spend what you don't have. Credit card and loan companies would try to convince you otherwise but what matters now is that you accept a financial restriction of some sort. There are ways you can show someone how much they mean to you without breaking the bank. Trust that someone is more easily pleased than you think. $\", '^ Yours is an Air sign, which gives you a gift for communications, which in all its many guises often comes naturally to you. But equally, you can be a bit detached emotionally, so when it comes to expressing deeper feelings, you can be rather backwards, in coming forwards. That is until this week, when you may be far more open, perhaps even a bit gushy. $', \"^ Think about all the things you didn't like when you were younger. Back then, you understood authority figures had the upper hand. You didn't believe yourself to be in a position to argue or negotiate. Now, you find yourself not only being told what to do but expected to undertake a steep learning curve of some kind. Soon, you'll be grateful for what appears to be enforced. $\", '^ You might appear selfish in the eyes of someone by pursuing something that matters to or suits you. However, there are benefits to doing whatever brings you happiness or self-fulfillment. If your emotional reserves need replenishing, then focusing on doing what pleases you needs to be a priority. You can afford to relinquish control of from something you feel you must keep constant control of. $', \"^ If you're unaware of how you're noticed or listened to by others in some way, then that will become clearer soon. The fact that you've proved yourself in some way needs to be understood in the first instance. If you feel you've been tested or observed closely by others, then whatever you've done has probably been met with approval. Although there is still more to be done to gain further support, you can afford to be more relaxed regarding how you do this. $\", '^ The Moon in your sign gives you a chance to ask the Cosmos for what you want. It doesnt matter what it is - today you have a very reasonable chance that you may just get it. This is also a great opportunity to write down all your wishes, dreams, hopes and goals for the months ahead and stash the list away. Good things will happen as a result. $', \"^ We all have a need to interact in some way with those around us. We have a choice about the extent to which we do this. When we allow ourselves to become embroiled in others' disputes or arguments though, we've crossed a line surrounding what is and isn't appropriate to be involved with. By all means, be supportive of someone but don't allow their problem to become yours too. $\", \"^ We have pretty good reason to believe that we are put on this planet to learn. Life is meant to be a learning experience. That seems to make sense and be a sensible agenda from our Creator. But what happens to all that we learn that ends up being stored and not used or referred to again? Does it end up in a folder in our brain marked 'Experience'? Something you learned from experience previously is finally about to come in very handy now! $\", \"^ 'All good things', they say, 'must come to an end'. People make such statements when they feel we must be brought back down to earth or more realistic. In truth, things don't end; they change in appearance or form and you're experiencing a shift in a certain area. Don't believe something is finishing. It's adjusting itself to become something much better and more appropriate. $\", \"^ When people talk about a need to go to great lengths to get to the bottom of something or make sense of a complex situation, they refer to 'reinventing the wheel'. You can, if you choose to do so, spend considerable amounts of time wondering how a particular development came to be and attempt to draw from the past what you need to apply in the present to rectify it. Don't dwell on the past. Look at what you have available now and you'll see you have all you need to make a significant improvement. $\", \"^ A certain situation is likely to be tiring. Even the thought of giving more time and effort toward it makes you weary. A scenario shows little sign of changing or progressing in ways you wish it would. You have reason to believe you're stuck in a 'put up and shut up' situation. The sky hasn't been as helpful as it could be where this frustrating scenario is concerned. It now intends to address this. Don't become suspicious when you do actually start seeing progress made! $\", \"^ Changes in attitudes are not always immediately obvious to us. We don't always wake one morning to discover an upgrade to our mindset has occurred while we slept. Sometimes, it's not until we find ourselves reacting or responding in surprising ways that we discover we see an old situation in a new light. Welcome such a revelation in your world. You'll soon see how even a small shift in attitude can help you rise above what you once felt inferior to. $\", \"^ How much are you willing tolerate? Are you happy with an imbalance in a relationship and, if so, what can be done about it? These are just two of many questions posed by the sky to you now. Your patience with a certain person's behavior appears to be wearing thin. Equally, you're wondering why they believe they should have such control of your relationship. Resist the urge to confront them, for the time being anyway. Bide your time, if you can, for just a little while longer. $\", '^ Your mind can travel very quickly. This sees you speedily understand concepts that others can take much longer to figure out. But what about those situations where you see things but others dont get what you mean. What does that do for you? The chances are this causes you frustration and frayed nerves. Factor in some leeway for lesser mortals. $', \"^ You could be tempted to throw caution to the wind and focus your time and efforts on what truly interests you, rather than stick with what's mundane in the real world. The spontaneous Gemini Moon might make it extra tempting to ditch responsibilities to focus on what might result if you had a chance to throw yourself into a more inspiring or promising pursuit. The choice is yours, and your heart is the best sounding board you could want at this time. Whatever you decide, stick with it and give your all. $\", \"^ When a problem presents itself, we sometimes convince ourselves it has been carefully engineered by spiteful and unhelpful unseen forces determined to do nothing more than put obstacles in the way of important and cherished plans. We even believe we're being subjected to some form or cosmic or karmic punishment when others around us lead seemingly problem-free lives. It's time for you to tackle a problem, show it 'who's boss' and how undaunted by it you are! $\", \"^ Long ago, Man looked at mountains and believed no human being would ever conquer them. Now, many 'un-conquerable' mountains have been climbed several times. The same thoughts were made about the Moon. Now, space stations are being built. You might believe you're in a difficult or impossible situation. Trust that you can conquer what seems a mammoth task. $\", '^ Not everyone is as straightforward in their dealings as you might hope theyd be. Hidden resentments which have been simmering on the backburner for some time, can be particularly potent today, but then these can be yours as much as anyone elses. However, before you speak out, be mindful of the repercussions, for a lot of upset can ensue. $', \"^ Being too philosophical where conveying yourself verbally is concerned could cause your audience to nod off and kill the magic in your message that being more down-to-Earth will convey. Making a point doesn't require you to go to great lengths to ensure every base needs covering if you're to be truly understood. Whoever you're trying to convey yourself to is capable of filling in more gaps imaginatively than you might be giving them credit for. $\", \"^ The most simplest solutions have a tendency to stare us squarely in the face. Yet, if we convince ourselves that our ability to find a solution requires brainpower or experience we believe we don't possess, then we make what is simple so unnecessarily complicated through believing ourselves to be 'beneath' the issue itself. You're 'bigger' than the issue you're now wrestling with. It has no intention of being seen to be superior so don't allow it to become so. $\", \"^ A glimmer of hope or an encouraging reason to feel more optimistic and relaxed than you've felt recently could take the edge off what has been tense or uncertain. Where you've felt you must keep your distance or watch a situation from the sidelines; you can involve yourself more at this time. If tension or uncertainty have permeated a close relationship recently, then a bit of warmth can transform what has been cool or cold. $\", \"^ You might be more reliant on others for essential information than you wish you were, but what comes your way now or shortly should be helpful and revealing. This could be particularly true if your interactions involve people connected with afar or overseas. If you're waiting for something travel-related to become finalized or have plans in the pipeline that involve someone at a distance, then you could receive a proverbial green light or some form of reassuring news shortly. $\", \"^ Here's a trick for you to try on yourself on a willing participant. Say the word 'joke' six times. Then ask 'what's the white part of an egg called?'. Most people respond by saying 'yolk' because an association has been made with a similar sounding word. It's interesting that, despite what's being asked being done so clearly, an assumption is made automatically. Make a point of listening to what's being said to or asked of you. A wrong answer could result with egg on your face. $\", '^ Funny how things go, just a few days ago it seemed that other people couldnt wait to doubt some of your less straightforward ideas, today, as long as you deliver the message with just the right mix of confidence and informality, they can be all ears. Friends also continue to be a rich source of encouragement and this is rarely a weak area for you. $', \"^ If every salesperson sold successfully to every person they tried to sell to, they'd be billionaires. They'd also be bored. We need obstacles and challenges to make life more interesting and as much as you probably resent the challenge you now face, you are 'live' to how fantastic you will feel when you eventually overcome it. You can make a very big difference to an area of your world by facing and tackling something that you find daunting. $\", \"^ All you appear to want is 'the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth'. What you're getting is a deceptive or unrealistic overview of a situation probably relating to a close personal involvement. You suspect there's more to a scenario than meets the eye. Whilst this may be true, it's important to understand why you're being fed information on a 'need to know' basis. Someone has their reasons for not being as forthcoming as you'd prefer, as you're about to discover. $\", \"^ We summon energy and enthusiasm for what energizes and enthuses us. That usually happens because our faith levels are high or we have little difficulty identifying what we'll enjoy from doing something. Your energy and enthusiasm levels toward a certain task or plan are understandably low but a way must be tried. Make some effort and you're likely to be glad you did. $\", \"^ My dog ate my homework. The payment is in the post. The appointment slipped my mind. I could go on and list more excuses we all hear regularly but the point I want to make surrounds an excuse you're being given now. Someone isn't reneging on an arrangement; they're just moving goalposts in a way that suits them. Count to ten and accept that keeping your cool will be far preferable to a heated exchange. $\", \"^ People often say, 'any publicity is good publicity.' That's not always true, though. Countless news stories exist where certain people attracted attention to themselves for the wrong reasons and didn't benefit in any way from doing so. We can also be unaware of the signals we send to others and how this makes us appear. Fortunately, you're superbly placed to draw attention to yourself in some way now. Ensure you're seen in a way you truly want to be seen. $\", \"^ The sky suggests you're being pulled in more than one direction. This could be the result of more than one person demanding time or attention. It could also be the result of you being undecided about how best to proceed with the pursuit of more than one plan or commitment. If you're growing weary from having to spread yourself a bit too thinly, be patient. Release is imminent. $\", \"^ Words we utter to others can be very boomerang-like sometimes. We inadvertently say one thing to one person only to discover through a 'Chinese Whisper' or other effect that our words have returned to us with a totally different meaning or interpretation. Be very 'live' to the fact now that your words not only carry more weight than usual, they are likely to travel much further than you could have possibly imagined. $\", \"^ We don't need to monitor every process unfolding in our lives. We can't see half of them anyway, and ought to trust that many will occur with or without our intervention. Even the most controlling person accepts that they must allow some processes to do what they intend to do in their own way. You can remove much stress from your world if you release your grip on a situation you believe needs monitoring and controlling closely. It doesn't. $\", '^ You might find yourself being more open today than for a long time. And even if there are one or two people that you encounter that you sense find your quirky or individualistic ways harder to bear, you may just shrug. Surf any extra confidence you feel, for this can continue to draw even more good fortune your way, especially around unusual ideas. $', \"^ Something is showing signs of slowing down and becoming more manageable. Having gone from a 'stop-start-stop' scenario in some ways to a 'turn on a dime' scenario in others, you're hopefully finding tension and uncertainty brought during weeks to be diminishing. There are relationship and commitment decisions beckoning for your time and attention but you're more likely to have energy and inclination to deal with these swiftly and permanently. Enjoy the respite. $\", \"^ You could feel gung-ho to take a bold step but also aware of how and why you need to assess the more sensitive energies involved. Even if you're acting solely on a hunch and ignoring the absence of facts, you might need to accept that you can't give in to your impetuous side in a way you're keen to. If something is truly worth doing, then it's worth doing carefully, methodically and sensibly. $\", \"^ We are told we regret what we don't do in life. Clearly, there are times when we regret what we have done, even if we can identify ways in which we ultimately benefited from our actions or decisions. It can be difficult to shake off the feeling that we should have done or said something differently. You appear to be nurturing regret now but are perhaps not recognizing how you know more now than you did previously about the reality of a situation. That can only be a good thing. $\", \"^ As exhilarating as roller coasters are for those who enjoy them, they're not without a few bumps along the way. Adrenaline surges we experience are combined with twists, turns and the occasional knock that goes largely unnoticed. You're embarking upon a process that holds massive potential where your future happiness and security are concerned. Don't be too concerned with how much the journey seems to be twisting and giving you the occasional jolt. They're just a small and temporary part of what promises to be a very enjoyable ride. $\", \"^ What's !60 x 8 x 22 x 95 x 0? How easy was that? If you spotted the zero, then you knew instantly that there was no point in working out the first part of the equation. The same applies in your world now. If you can see the bigger picture available, then you can see how the need to do more than necessary to achieve a result is reduced if not eliminated altogether. Avoid any tendency to jump to a conclusion or believe something to be difficult just because it appears difficult. $\", \"^ Years ago, medicine manufacturers were unconcerned with how medicines tasted. What mattered was the fact they 'worked'. To get around bad taste associated with most medicines, people would swallow a spoonful of sugar to make it more tolerable. What appears unpleasant in your world now is about to sweetened in a lovely way and appear much more appealing soon. $\", \"^ Your cosmic mission could involve not allowing your defenses to rise when dealing with others, especially if you believe it's wise to fight fire with fire where one demanding individual is concerned. You could feel inclined to 'give as good as you get' and that approach won't get you anywhere. Looking beyond the obvious at what's causing someone to behave the way they are could reveal an intriguing answer that relies on you reacting sensitively, not confrontationally. $\", \"^ Having final say on a certain matter isn't just helpful, it's essential. As much as you might understand others' reasons for wanting to explore umpteen options, you can see what needs to be done, why it needs to be done a certain way and why your way is the way it should be done. You're right to go easy on those who are trying to help by offering alternative suggestions. $\", \"^ Your help, were it offered in ways you would like to offer it, wouldn't be refused within certain quarters. So what's the problem? Well, there's an issue surrounding fairness with someone else that needs to be taken into account. It appears what you do for one must also be done for another. There is also an issue involving your conscience. Are you really wanting to help someone or might the act of helping them go some way to making you feel better about yourself in some way? (Does it really matter if it's the latter?) $\", \"^ You might be aware of what's beyond your control to influence or change but could still focus your attention intensely on possible options. This is only going to increase your frustration levels. Focus instead on what is within your control and look beyond your personal world for ways you can make a difference to others' worlds. Otherwise, you could overlook or inadvertently ignore what's occurring with a friend or family member. Responding with kindness and compassion confirms how seriously you take the well-being of those closest to you. $\", \"^ When we observe what's occurring in others' lives, see only brief snapshots of what they're experiencing. We can learn by doing so, especially if we believe someone is handling a situation more effectively than we would have done if we were in the same position. The sky speaks of a similar discovery being made by you. Someone else's story can offer helpful insight into how you can handle a similar scenario more efficiently. $\", \"^ It is derogatory to refer to someone as a 'sponge'. Are we not all 'sponges' in our own ways, constantly absorbing and processing information? Such processes needn't be one-way, either. We're often very willing and keen to share what we learn with others as someone born under your sign knows so well. You have an excellent chance to impart knowledge in a particular way. Don't be modest about your experience and what you can offer. $\", \"^ Successful people tell us we should be concerned if others aren't talking about us. Successful people believe power that comes from success means others will and should find reasons to talk about and compare themselves to them. Whether or not you agree with such a statement, you could be aware of how you're now being seen in the eyes of certain others. What do you want them to be saying about you? That's something you do have power to influence. $\", \"^ There's almost always a big difference between what we believe we need and what we truly need. If we ask for something, then it's usually because we're certain we want it. However, getting something we didn't expect can result in us failing to see how what we've been given is something we need, even if we're unaware of this. Be careful what you ask for now. You're likely to be given what you need instead of what you want. In time, you'll accept how unhelpful your 'want' was! $\", \"^ Information coming to light now might be information you wish had emerged some time ago. As is often the case when this happens, a plan or two must be revised or readjusted. However, don't overlook support you're receiving from those whom you need support from. You could even discover that one or two others take a matter as seriously as you do, despite appearances to the contrary. $\", \"^ 'Opinions,' as the saying goes, 'are like (a certain part of the anatomy), everyone has one.' Whether you're encouraging others to offer advice or input, you look set to receive either or both. You might understandably wonder why anyone feels they have the right to draw attention to what you should be doing in a particular way. Others can make suggestions. Whether or not you take them on board is entirely up to you. Smiling, nodding and continuing as you were is an option. $\", '^ Links formed at work, can prove helpful. Perhaps you and a colleague will spark up a genuine personal rapport, or if you have your own small business, you can network well with another entrepreneur. In love and socially, there are lots of possibilities for fun and frivolity, and letting go and enjoying yourself can be therapeutic. $', \"^ No matter how well or long we know someone, we never truly know them. Each of us has aspects of our personalities we're keen to protect, even from those we know best or love most. When we discover something about someone we know well that surprises us, we're sometimes unsure how best to respond. The discovery you're making now about a certain person can only benefit you. $\", \"^ You can't help feeling what you feel but might be weary from having to put on a brave face for the benefit of others or perhaps one person in particular. You appear to be looked toward for leadership or your ability to take control of a certain situation. Is leading or taking control something you feel should be your responsibility? Try your best to accept what's being delegated your direction now. You're likely to find others' faith in your abilities isn't misplaced. $\", \"^ We often find the process of trying to achieve a particular goal to be exciting and motivating. When we accomplish what we set out to do, it's not uncommon for excitement to wane. This can then cause us to wonder how important the goal really was to us. The challenge surrounding getting it could have been what was spurring us on. If you experience such a realization, then try to at least see how accomplishing something is a helpful stepping stone to something bigger. $\", \"^ Someone's determination to instigate an argument could be reflective of a much bigger picture. You could see their reasons as wanting to be nothing more than obstructive or an exercise in 'who wears the pants' or who's 'in control'. The sky suggests they might simply be testing you in some way, to see where your breaking point exists or how much belief you actually have in what you're saying or defending. See the drama unfolding now as a mere storm in a teacup. $\", \"^ We know what it's like to carry a heavy rucksack for lengthy periods of time and how extra weight affects our abilities. With that in mind, think of what your future has to carry now in the form of unnecessary baggage from your past. Attention being given to your past is undoubtedly affecting the future. So, you know what needs to be done with whatever aspect of the past is the problem! $\", \"^ As children, we absorb the teachings of our parents and teachers. We have no reason to question them. We're generally happy to accept what we're being told is true and right. At some point though, we begin to question, layer upon layer, what we have been told or taught. We exercise our right to draw our own conclusions. You are right to question a long held belief now. $\", \"^ If you need proof of an ability you possess before having faith in it, then the cosmos is keen to provide evidence you need. You might suspect you're capable of conquering a challenge presenting itself now but might also need more reassurance that you can do what needs doing. However, as the saying goes, you won't know unless you try. That puts you in a Catch-22 situation because proof you need will only come once you've made some effort to bring it. $\", \"^ You might believe someone else's problem or dilemma is theirs to resolve and it would be preferable from your point of view if you were able to be detached from it. Yet, you appear to have an indirect connection with whatever-it-is in some way. For now and until your help or input is called upon, keep your distance. You will have an opportunity to have your say or provide input before long. Allow someone time and space to resolve the issue their way first. $\", \"^ They say we regret what we don't do in life. To a large extent, that's true but we can all recall having made decisions not to do something and being glad we didn't. You appear to be considering action you believe to be necessary but carries with it more than one disbenefit to both you and someone else. I strongly suspect that, on this occasion, you'll soon have a very good reason to feel relieved with not having pursued it. $\", \"^ Is it a case of bettering a particular Devil you know? One option available to you appears enticing yet playing it safe in some way with regard to another option appears more appealing. You could be loath to upset an equilibrium  or a particular person  by taking a risk. This, in turn, involves following your heart. You owe it to yourself to explore what's on offer by a least favorable option now. It will bring upheaval but, in many ways, that's precisely what's needed. $\", \"^ A solution or way forward with a certain matter might appear obvious  but could it be too obvious? Perhaps, you're approaching an issue in the same way you've always approached it. You might believe you should better a certain devil you know than take unprecedented action. However, there are clear benefits to trying the untried or refusing to stick with protocol. Give an alternative approach some attention. $\", \"^ How many people believe they could do a better job managing their favorite football team than the team's manager? How many believe they could run a country better than any other Prime Minister or President? Many of us have misplaced ideas about our expertise. Don't be taken in now by someone who thinks the same about something you're doing. $\", '^ How perfect does something in your world need to be? We strive for perfection in so many ways but is it really perfection we must always strive for? Can a less than perfect result still be a very desirable one? Of course it can. Ask any Olympic athlete. A silver or bronze medal is a fantastic award for achievement. Your desire to strive for perfection is admirable but take a moment to consider if it really is necessary. Less than perfect might just satisfy you greatly. $', \"^ Sometimes, signs we see whilst driving serve obvious purposes. We wonder why someone felt we needed to be reminded to stop, give way or whatever. Yet, we know they could be there to benefit others and think no more about it. There is something you're very tuned into now that you are at risk of resenting having brought to your attention. Someone else isn't being authoritative for the sake of it. There's something you can benefit or learn from, despite how much you already know. $\", \"^ Where an ongoing romantic or emotional issue is concerned, Venus intends to bring not only comfort but resolution. Something of an emotional nature has drifted for too long. A relationship issue has been ignored. This is precisely what Venus intends to address and you needn't worry that the result will be one you won't regard as ideal. A strong case is about to presented on your behalf and someone's eyes are about to be opened. $\", \"^ Whom do you need to speak with? Why do you need to engage in another difficult conversation? Have you not made your point clear previously and believed a certain person understood what you were telling or requesting of them? History appears to be repeating itself in some way now but, as frustrating as it might be to have to cover old ground, the discussion will be different this time. You're armed with more strength and wisdom. You will be understood this time. $\", \"^ Has someone's interest in a shared idea or venture waned? You have every reason to believe it has and trying to motivate a certain person or encourage them to do what was agreed has been like wading through treacle. Yet, you haven't lost faith completely. You've been understanding of their situation, even if it has meant more than one frustrating delay. Very shortly, you're about to see how committed they really are and it will please you greatly. $\", \"^ Sometimes, it's what someone doesn't say that is the most powerful. Someone can talk the hind legs off a donkey and still say nothing meaningful yet the words could be concealing a much deeper, greater need. There might be something they're hoping someone else will pick up on and pursue. That makes it easier to say what's difficult to say. Don't be too dismissive now of a barrage of words coming your direction from a certain person. If you're willing to look a bit deeper into what's being said, then a much more important message is likely to be found. $\", '^ The Moon is going to helpfully aspect four planets in your zodiac sign over the weekend, suggesting that this can be a time of special developments. However, a decision about an old relationship can also be made, or see one which has been bubbling away on the back burner, spark into life. There is still a sense of mystery, but you can also cut a dash. $', \"^ You need to have reasonable expectations around your interactions with others. This is especially so if you're someone who really dislikes petty politics. However, the fact is, that politics are part of everyday life, so rather than trying to ignore whats going on around you, at the least keep abreast of this. After all, you dont need to actively participate. $\", \"^ Sometimes, confidence needs harnessing in particular ways to ensure it's working for us effectively and appropriately. We know it's possible to have too much confidence as well, and errors or misjudgments often highlight this. However, when we receive a confidence boost, we know it and see for ourselves how it spurs us on to make amazing things happen and achieve surprising results. Be clear about how you want your imminent confidence boost to work for you! $\", \"^ A discovery appears imminent and this could shed helpful light on a particular matter you've chosen to see in a specific way. You've done a good job of ensuring something 'added up', even if you knew essential pieces of the puzzle were missing. Expect soon to experience a change of mind, change of heart or a shift in attitude toward what you have invested much faith in so far. You'll be grateful for those final missing pieces of the puzzle! $\", \"^ What criteria do we measure relationships against? Each of us has at least a few guidelines surrounding what we expect from those closest to us even if they aren't always immediately apparent. Should we feel we don't have any need to do so, this is often due to complacency that might have set in with regard to interactions with certain people. It appears you are keen to introduce a breath of fresh air into one particular relationship and this is bound to prove helpful. $\", \"^ Levers are amazing things. With gentle pressure, huge objects can be shifted or moved. It's important to bear this in mind now where something close to your heart is concerned. What appears unmovable or insurmountable can be moved or overcome with the tiniest amount of effort now. All you need to do is be willing to apply it rather than accept the task as impossible. $\", \"^ When we experience a bit of chaos in our lives, we first question what we did to cause it. We wonder what we might have overlooked or done in a careless way to have caused it. Yet, what we do overlook is how much goes on in the background of our lives and how, at times, much of this manifests in ways we had no idea even existed. Don't feel resentful toward a bit of chaos manifesting in your world now. It is precisely what you need in some way. $\", \"^ Most of us possess enough intelligence to know that, if something appears too good to be true, then it usually is. Our instincts tend to be accurate when we find ourselves feeling doubtful about an opportunity that doesn't 'add up' in the right way. You have reason to be wary about something proposed to you now. You are right to reserve judgment until more facts are available. $\", '^ In the same way leaking water will cause more damage if ignored, so too will certain problems if allowed to fester. Even worse is the way we convince ourselves sometimes that the decision to not take action was made for a good reason. There is an issue you cannot ignore now. Take one brave step to solving it and you will solve it in a wonderful and potentially permanent way. $', \"^ Resist pushing a certain point until someone succumbs to your way of thinking. Just because you receive agreement doesn't necessarily mean you've won. If your ideas are met with resistance by someone you need on your side, then look closely at where a compromise can be reached. Wearing someone down by laboring a point won't help with instilling the sense of comradery needed to get an idea or plan off the ground. $\", '^ Later today you can spark and really come to life. There may have already been a good deal of activity earlier in the day, but once you really feel this sense of zip, you can be \"up\" for extending your evening. Yet staying in one haunt will probably only suit you if you are having great conversation, more likely youll move around quite a bit. $', \"^ How many times do we say to ourselves 'oh dear, what's happening isn't what I thought would happen or wanted to happen'? Out best laid plans often go 'skewiffy'. We then panic and believe that something is running away from us out of control. Don't look at a situation in your world now, wondering how or why it has unfolded in a way it has. Trust that what's unfolding is ideal even if it doesn't appear to match what you consider to be ideal. $\", \"^ Issues around your personal identity are at stake. If you're someone with a real sense of clarity about who you are, this can be a week when you can use your knack of tuning into trends, successfully. If however, you do tend to doubt yourself, you can feel confused, and question yourself and your own motives. You may also be evasive if anyone pries. $\", \"^ Many of us have pushed a 'send' button before we intended to. Once pushed, it's too late to do anything about it, no matter how well connected we are in technological circles. There are also messages or emails that we ought to create and leave for a day or so. When we return to them with a clear and less stressed mind, we see them differently. Avoid succumbing to speaking your mind now. Count to ten or step aside. You might end up wishing you'd showed some restraint. $\", \"^ Some people are easily bored. They don't seek inspirational things to do or discuss. They find reasons not to do something. Then, they complain about being bored! There are reasons why you must remove yourself from a comfort zone. You could create a list of reasons why doing so will make you uncomfortable but a bit of discomfort is what's needed now to seize a wonderful opportunity. It's time to seize something inspiring that has been trying to get your attention. $\", \"^ In what ways are you letting someone down? What should you be doing that you're not already doing? This list of questions could become a lot longer if you wanted it to but it's important you recognize that you're not at fault in ways you're being led to believe. Someone's enjoying having influence over you in some way. It's convenient for them to be able to 'pass the buck' your direction. Soon, it will be clear to them and others that doing so is both unfair and unacceptable. $\", \"^ You have, at your disposal now, the ability to bring about much needed change. You're probably aware of how, with some focused effort and the swallowing of some pride, you can achieve a particular result. It's the fact that something you've grown used to will change that is probably causing you to be hesitant. The benefits of taking action now are many. $\", \"^ We can wish and wish for something to happen until proverbial cows come home but there comes a time when we have to get off of our backsides and see what the investment of a bit of effort will bring us. It's possible you're busy looking for a solution that has every intention of presenting itself if you're willing to make some effort to find it. It won't come to you. So, look at what might be puzzling you now and what you can do to find out more about what makes it 'tick'. $\", \"^ There's nothing wrong with changing our minds, sometimes. If we are subjected to a flash of inspiration that sheds new and exciting light on something we were pursuing in another way, then surely that can only be helpful, positive and productive? You might see a change of mind on your part as a way of taking you back to Square One where a plan is concerned but you're about to discover how it represents the most sensible option for you. $\", \"^ Wanting recognition of your efforts or abilities could cause you to wait longer than you're prepared to. You might need to draw someone's attention to what you've done and can do. This isn't a case of trumpet blowing or attention seeking. If someone was a bit more proactive and imaginative, then you probably wouldn't have to go to such lengths to be recognized. However, reminding someone of what you bring to the proverbial party helps both of you. $\", \"^ The Moon in your sign could be instrumental in making a particular conversation or exchange unnecessarily complex or possibly dramatic. Try to consider how you're reacting to what's being conveyed because someone else's reactions or responses could be mirroring your own, causing things to escalate. Reacting emotionally needn't be the same as reacting defensively. Be passionate but try not to be overbearing. $\", \"^ Try to curb your frustration at seeing what's glaringly obvious in a situation that has others scratching their heads and rubbing their chins. A certain fact couldn't be plainer as far as you're concerned but it might be taking some time for the penny to drop in others' eyes or minds. If you must highlight what needs highlighting, then try to do so in a hands-off sort of way. The more you allow a revelation to come on its own, the more powerful and helpful it will be. $\", \"^ How long can an argument or debate last? How long is a piece of string? History is full of battles and heated discussions that went on for many years. For as long as both sides believes they are right and refuse to yield or compromise, then such tension can last forever. The thing about battles is, someone always gets caught in the middle of them. They are in 'middle ground' territory and refuse to take sides. It is 'middle ground' you are about to reach with someone now. $\", '^ If you are looking for new accommodation, you may be able to snaffle yourself an absolute gem. It may not be the price, if you are buying or the cost of the lease if you are renting, as much as its location, condition, and the environment that this place is located within. A dream property may seem a bit idealistic, but you just never know your luck Aquarius. $', \"^ We don't need a degree in psychology or human behavior to know if we tell ourselves something enough times, then we eventually believe it. This powerful process works in two ways, too. If we focus on what's negative and convince ourselves of negative outcomes, then they invariably occur. Yet, there's something about focusing on positive developments that causes us to believe we're kidding ourselves. Allow a very positive development unfolding now to prove you wrong! $\", \"^ Whoever invented the wheel was likely aware of a way they'd been struggling and it dawned on them a process could be made easier and simpler by adding a simple component to a plan. They since learned to involve this in other ways and we benefit from their wisdom, insight and experience today. The moral of this story surrounds willingness to apply ingenuity to situation that can reduce a need to struggle alone. A Eureka Moment coming now will ensure that happens. $\", \"^ Your playful side could be hard to access, even if you're in a position to relax and be an observer in ways you might not normally be. You might also appear emotionally restrained to those around you and tension could arise from wanting to do something your way or on your own. If you must do something solo, then allow others to understand your reasons, rather than leave them wondering. $\", \"^ Spontaneity is often undervalued. We learn over time how many opportunities should be seized and that whoever hesitates is 'lost'. The result of impulsive action often involves a need to redress imbalance, or start over in a certain area. You're likely aware of impulsiveness you've shown in a certain area and what now needs to be done to 'fix' it or invest time sorting it out. You haven't made an incorrect decision. Neither have you acted impulsively. You're being encouraged to improve something that you truly need. $\", \"^ You appear to have an important role to play in a scenario that involves more than one person. You might be unaware of how integral you are to a process or it's possible you might be underestimating how loved and respected you are. In any case, you've played an important role in bringing joy and delight to at least one person's world. Soon, at least one kindhearted gesture made your direction will make this much clearer. $\", \"^ You could be forgiven for feeling like a child being made to stand in a corner. It might appear you're being punished or excluded and are meant to be reflecting upon what you did or didn't do to end up there. By all means, use this time to ascertain your next move but don't believe you're guilty of anything. Truth about this will be revealed soon enough. $\", \"^ If someone would cooperate, then life would undoubtedly be easier. You're giving effort to a particular area in the hope that someone will recognize what you're trying to achieve. Instead of offering help, they're putting up obstacles. They need to know how important your objective is. Make it clear now. $\", \"^ You could surprise someone and possibly yourself with your assertiveness. However, your mission now involves knowing when you've made your point and when it's wise to leave a matter alone. You could be prone to going a bit over the top long after your point has been made. This will likely result in an apology later on, so by all means, put your foot down where necessary but be sensitive toward someone's feelings when doing so. $\", \"^ There are times when we find ourselves breathing sighs of relief when we believe we finally know where we stand with a situation or individual. We invest time to see a scenario or person in what we believe to be an accurate light and then discover something about it or them has changed and we must now reassess our position. You aren't starting from Square One through reassessing an arrangement but the process is a necessary one in light of what has changed within it. $\", \"^ You might view a situation unfolding as a challenge. If you choose to see it in such a way, then that's fine because you'll rise to it admirably and see how it poses no threat or difficulty. If, however, you're willing to see what's begging for attention as something encouraging you to consider what you hadn't considered or push you gently in a direction you hadn't considered going toward, then you'll see how what's occurring wants you to work with and not be fearful of it. $\", \"^ Does a certain relationship need to fall by the wayside? For some time, you've had quiet concerns about where something between you and a certain person was heading but writing might appear to be appearing on the wall now. You're being encouraged to assess this and one or two other connections in your world now. It's time to decide who is worthy of your time, efforts or more and $\", \"^ Some people are obsessed with planning. They like to ensure plans are well planned in order to ensure everything goes to plan. There's nothing wrong with planning, it's essential in many ways and for much we do or should be doing but we reach a point where enough planning has been done and we need to get on with what needs doing. That's a situation you appear to be at now. $\", \"^ We can be a bit too harsh sometimes about what we believe we do and don't deserve. We tell ourselves we can't have something and then justify reasons why we don't deserve it. Making an effort to summon confidence and accept that you shouldn't settle for second best or downsize an expectation are your tickets to making real, tangible progress - where you deserve it! $\", '^ Some profound changes can affect where you live and even who you live with. If you have been feeling unsettled you may feel you have little choice but to try your luck in a new location. If your accommodation makes you miserable, here too a change of scene can be positive. You can also understand some deeper, inner motivations. $', '^ All sorts of ideas are bubbling up from the depths, but a friend may seem dismissive. All you can do is believe in what you want to do. If this means that you have to go your own way, then try to accept this. Luckily you are one of the zodiac signs that can be very strong about being your own person. Others would find this more of a struggle than you. $', \"^ If the social scene beckons, then try to heed its call. There are many benefits waiting for you if you're willing to meet and mingle, with both old and new friends alike. Something helpful and encouraging can come from increasing any effort to interact, so make yourself available, even briefly. A chance encounter definitely isn't out of the question! $\", '^ Aquarians cannot be described \"group wide\" about anything much, least of all romance, where your take can be singularly individual  good for you, if so. However, the chance to begin again, fall head over heels (OK, I know, a fanciful thought) or to draw closer to your current partner is definitely possible in the next ten days. Seize the opportunity. $', '^ We understand little ever happens without effort. We also understand the need to be patient when pursuing something. Our struggle often surrounds balancing effort with patience! We sometimes forget to relax and take stock of our efforts. As difficult as it might be, give it a try. You stand to be enlightened in ways that will make future effort more focused or worthwhile. $', '^ The uncharted territory your imagination might be taking you to could feel both daunting and exciting at the same time. However, taking a step from something imagined to something real will need you to accept that some baggage from the past must be left behind. Being willing to accept what - or who - has held you back you is the first, essential step to envisioning a brighter future. $', \"^ At what point does a 'pupil' become a 'master'? For as long as the master has something of value to teach the pupil and the latter is willing to learn from them, then the situation will continue. Eventually, though, some pupils do succeed in gaining more knowledge than the person teaching them. In an area of your world now, you might be experiencing something similar. Be aware if time has come to find a new source of knowledge in whatever form you deem suitable. $\", '^ If you have been waiting for a discussion to materialize in something tangible, there is a good chance it can from now. That more down to earth side of your nature means that you are less interested than usual in originality and concepts and more concerned with things like paying off bills, selling unwanted goods, and getting excellent value for money. $', '^ Part of you can get caught up in the frenetic pace of life this week, whilst another part of you will just want to kick back and do as little as possible. Even the most industrious of Water Carriers, can go between these two poles. And yet, even if you do try to keep at things non-stop, glitches can crop up which will make you wonder why you bothered. $', \"^ We sometimes believe we're responsible for coming up with our own solutions to any problem. We usually feel such a way through believing a problem shared is a problem doubled or by being captains of our own destinies, we should take responsibility for devising solutions without involving others. It's the way you're possibly being stubborn in such a way now that is making a situation appear unnecessarily complex. If you need help or guidance, accept both on offer. $\", \"^ Many people are skilled in the art of persuasion. They engineer conversations to get specific results and the person they're persuading often doesn't realize how each step of the conversation is carefully planned. The sky speaks of you and someone else having such an exchange now. A more straightforward and honest discussion will bring a better and quicker result. $\", \"^ Where you might have expected or anticipated resistance from others surrounding an idea or plan, you could discover that its unique qualities are precisely what they've been looking for. You're bringing a fresh sense of innovation combined with imagination and might actually underestimate how much of a breath of fresh air you are to what's become tired and tedious. $\", \"^ Positive thoughts are not always easy to muster. Our brains struggle to motivate us when we're focused so intently on what has gone or might go wrong. That, in our mind, is much more worthy of our focus and attention. Of course, we need to address life's problems but you might be giving one too much attention now. Your biggest worry is probably much smaller than you believe. Distance yourself from it and accept more time must pass before an outcome can be determined. $\", \"^ How much more should you give? How much more can you give? It's natural for us to wonder what our efforts are getting us if we keep trying and see no desired results forthcoming. Perhaps though, you need to tweak your strategy. Someone's silence or apparent unwillingness to respond or cooperate might be the result of how you're choosing to deal with a certain matter. If they are reassured you're less defensive, then chances are, they will react similarly. $\", \"^ Refusing to budge or be swayed requires diligence, effort and focus. Perhaps that's why you're finding an ongoing situation to be so draining. You are, in some way, being coerced, cajoled or manipulated by a certain individual. An 'agree to disagree' scenario is likely to result but tension will be alleviated by you being presented with an option you haven't yet been able to consider. $\", '^ Is an end in sight now? In the same way someone driving at high speed on a highway for a long time has to snap out of their trance-like state when approaching a turn-off for their destination, you too are likely to become aware of a need to slow down and take stock of a new situation. Something has shifted. An ending is in sight and it marks the start of a very new chapter. $', \"^ Friends come, and friends go. The latter needn't always be upsetting, because sometimes, it happens. We enjoy bonding on different levels with different people and when the need to move on presents itself, we or they move on. Other friends, however, remain in our lives permanently and if you haven't had it made clear to you recently who your truest and most loyal friends are, you will soon receive a very heart-warming reminder. $\", '^ As much as you might want to prove yourself in some way, a more productive strategy involves allowing recognition to find you instead. Doing something to the best of your ability is supported by your undeniable and visible belief in yourself. Your quiet confidence attracts the right kind of attention now. Allow others to take notice of your star qualities  and accept compliments graciously. $', \"^ Expect all kinds of inner flotsam and jetsam to come to the surface including hidden anxieties, worries and fears. The Full Moon in your spiritual zone means you can harvest all kinds of goodies and treasures from the deep as well. Those stray intuitions or flashes of fantasy may be worth using. Don't discard potential gold dust. $\", \"^ The phrase 'train of thought' can be an appropriate one sometimes. Thoughts can appear suddenly, from out of nowhere. Sometimes, they go round and round a particular 'track'. They're also prone to arriving late! You've a lot to consider and process now. Focus on one thought that truly needs addressing. The rest really can be pushed to one side. $\", \"^ The words, 'it can't be done' or 'don't attempt that, it's impossible' often spur an Aquarian to prove otherwise. Just because someone else has attempted something with no success doesn't mean your innovative approach will bring the same result. It's the way in which you can adopt a different way of thinking to someone else that will bring success where failure has prevailed. You can see what someone else cannot. Apply yourself and success where others have failed is assured. $\", \"^ People speak sometimes about some situations being 'frozen in time' or we hear about time's ability to 'stand still'. None of us actually believes time is capable of being frozen or standing still. In the time you've read this, your life has moved on a few precious seconds. Yet, all too often we need reminding of how previous a gift life really is. If recent events haven't done much to remind you of this, then coming events definitely will. The time to take action is now. $\", \"^ Don't believe there's anything egotistical on your part by showing how capable you are in a particular way. You know your way is the right way something should be done and can draw upon previous experience and experienced-based wisdom to draw attention to yourself. Nobody is likely to question your ability either and being willing to step in and highlight a skill you possess benefits all concerned. $\", \"^ Everyone has their own needs and priorities and these should always be taken into account when trying to persuade someone in some way. If someone can see the benefits to them of co-operating or agreeing, then the task is usually made infinitely easier through them wanting, as opposed to feeling bullied. to do it. Your task now involves making benefits to someone of what you're asking of them clear. If you can, then progress is assured. All you need to do is provide a little bit of reassurance combined with a healthy dose of patience. $\", \"^ You've invested effort, put forth a strong argument to defend why you want what you want but it appears someone's choosing not to respond in a way you wish they would. This could be because you're overlooking a grander gesture being made. Someone intends to get your attention in another, much lovelier way. Just be patient for a bit longer. There's something you need to connect with and, once done. It will shed reassuring light on a currently confusing picture. $\", \"^ When we leave it others to guess what we're thinking or feeling, we leave much room for error. We know when it is obvious what someone is thinking or feeling but appearances can be deceptive sometimes. Brief preoccupation could be mistaken for something much stronger and deeper. That's why you should avoid encouraging others to guess what you're thinking or feeling in some way now. What's stopping you from making it clear to them? The answer is nothing. You owe it to yourself and others to remove guesswork. Just open you heart, mind and mouth. $\", \"^ The paths to true love and journeys to success are rarely unwinding or straight. Flexibility and adaptability are essential to achieving both. Where one plan or vision you're pursuing is concerned, the right blend of intuition and common sense will ensure you visualize the path you want to follow and keep any zigzagging or backtracking to a minimum! $\", \"^ Not so long ago, 'bigger was better'. Nowadays, micro technology is everywhere. Something in your world appears bigger than it is. In truth, it doesn't warrant attention you're inclined to give it. It is something smaller that you're prepared to overlook or disregard that holds the answer to your current dilemma or issue. The smallest of keys can open the hugest of doors now. Just be willing to make the effort and explore that which is hidden. $\", '^ Ever since last month, the Sun has been passing through the part of your solar horoscope concerned with your identity. If you are someone who is very clear in whom you are this may not have had a particularly noticeable affect. If however, things are more fluid for you just now, you may encounter a test or challenge. Someone may not seem very kind. $', \"^ Even the most adventurous person enjoys some levels of predictability in their lives. As much as they enjoy adrenaline surges or the thrill of achieving something thought to be beyond their abilities, they take comfort from relaxation and reassurance that comes from 'playing it safe' in some areas. You could gain something significant by doing similar now. $\", \"^ Social media websites allow for the world to know what they had for lunch or color of socks they're wearing that day but we tend to take keener interest in those who aren't so vocal or forthright. Someone you know is keeping quiet about information you'd prefer to be told. They're not being deceptive; they're just waiting for the right moment to reveal it to you! $\", \"^ You could be having second thoughts or reservations where pursuing a particular plan is concerned. What might have made sense at the time you agreed to embark upon it could be causing you to wonder why you chose to get involved. Perhaps, something has revealed itself to be more work than you thought it would be. But do you genuinely believe you'll have nothing to show for your efforts, patience and perseverance? You'll soon have reason to feel reassured. $\", \"^ You can either find yourself making an impulse purchase or discovering an unexpected cost. At the present, there is a bit of a theme of surprises coming into the open, so bear with this. Things will begin to be clearer for you from around mid-month, and pleasingly, this can be a time when your coffers, if they've been a bit bashed, can start to recover. $\", '^ You have a talent for friendship that is the envy of others. Why? Because you are often non judgmental and that means that you can get along well with people of all different ages, creeds, backgrounds and even nationalities. Whereas others see reasons not to be friends, you only see reasons to be friendly, and this side of you can flourish today. $', \"^ A certain person could probably benefit from a positive word of encouragement from you. This could - literally  require only one word: 'yes.' Where they've wanted you to see a situation from their point of view or encouraged you to accept their 'take' on a situation, you can bring closure to an ongoing uncertain or tense arrangement and rebuild a bond in a way it deserves. Pushing aside pride or resentment and responding positively helps both of you. $\", '^ Your natural friendliness and non-judgmental approach is likely to make you a popular party guest this month, as everybody wants you to be part of their scene. If cash has been slow, things will revive mid-month and it can be a case of who, as much as what, you know, that helps to drive this. Your future mindedness can also sparkle. You can spot trends ahead of the pack. $', \"^ Adrenaline surges tend to be brief. They exist to prime and protect us against what our brains perceive to be imminent danger. Yet, we all crave them and some more than others. In your world now, there is excitement on offer, probably involving exploration of previously unexplored territory in some way. To achieve excitement though, you're going to have to sacrifice security and comfort. Security and comfort last longer than excitement. That's worth remembering now. $\", \"^ Pride can come from achieving something singlehandedly but a greater sense of accomplishment can come from being part of a collaborative effort. That's the message from the sky to you now and whilst you might, in true Aquarian style, believe if something is to be done properly, then it needs to be done by you, consider the way many hands could make light work of what you want to achieve. You have all the support and resources you need. Try to make full use of them. $\", \"^ Some companies rely upon peoples' addictions. Profits come from providing what people believe they can't live without. Some might say such companies aren't helping those who rely on their products. Companies would say they're simply providing what people want. You can now become less reliant on something that someone else has an interest in you remaining reliant upon! $\", '^ The Moon can be good for you in its connection with dour Saturn, for any plans you have, you will be using all your powers of logic, to pick through any doubts or concerns you have. Or will you? There is also a chance that your concerns could take hold. If you feel a bit bleak, give the person a call who you know mixes consideration with a slice of perspective. $', '^ You can be fiercely independent, so what will you do, if over the weekend someone suggests putting in a good word for you? Pride goes before a fall Water Carrier and no-one can have too many friends or associates, so remain open-minded. In the weeks to come, something really good can come through such a link. Remember, no person is an island. $', \"^ We all react differently to pressure put upon us. Interestingly, we behave differently to pressure we put on others. When we create a sense of urgency about something, we get caught up in the moment and play an integral role in encouraging or escalating certain situations. Pressure you're putting on one or two people now is having a direct result on pressure you're experiencing. Do what needs doing and then step away. Leave a process you started to unfold on its own. $\", \"^ Here's a test for you. When I count to three, see if you can find something to worry about. Onetwothree! How did you do? Did you think of something immediately? Most of us can. The real trouble with worrying is, we forget that we should only worry about something only long enough to do something about it. A worry you might be nurturing needs an action plan. If you can create one and take the initiative, then that worry will become one you can strike off your list. $\", '^ Even the most committed of happily solo Water Carriers may find that their independence is tested by the backdrop of a sensational Solar Eclipse. This can soon see you drawn to someone who can teach you aspects of loving that you simply had no idea existed. Nor be surprised if this person is a mixture of the homely and totally exotic. $', '^ You certainly wont be lacking in inspiration today, but brilliant ideas need to be melded with down-to-earth application. The Moon will help you here but there can be a growing sense of frustration if your ideas or words are ignored by someone you are keen to hear them. Yet the more exasperated you get, the less they will listen to you. $', \"^ The key to bringing about a change you desire and transform a seemingly stale situation into a much more colorful one that offers much more in the way of opportunity is to be willing to apply imagination. Think outside the proverbial box. It's something you likely excel at doing, anyway. Be willing to take a calculated risk. Don't ignore the creative side to you that is begging to be given the chance to show you what imagination mixed with effort can achieve. $\", \"^ You're not known for being secretive, anything but, and yet most of us have things that we'd rather not like made public. However, today, something to do with your love life could just creep into view. Perhaps someone you are involved with is going to spring a surprise, or how someone sees you, may not be how you see yourself. $\", '^ Restrictions in one area of your plans, means you cant always deal your own cards as you would normally wish. However, you still have scope in which to plan and experiment. There are numerous possibilities and paths to explore. Now, all you have to do is seize them. Remember that niggles, delays and other pressures are purely transitory. $', \"^ It's important not to underestimate the influence you hold at this time. You could be unknowingly persuasive and might also be inclined to look for 'the catch' if you gain sudden support or agreement from a certain person whom you normally have to put forth a compelling argument. If there's anyone you want to gain approval from, then now is an ideal time to let your charm do half the work for you. $\", \"^ A lunar influence could play a part in your reduced enthusiasm and motivation levels, but this phase will be brief. Your lack of motivation might not be helped by pressure coming your way from several directions, and this can make performing the simplest task feel impossible. Focus on what you know to be manageable and most essential. If any obligation can wait for a couple of days, then you'll likely find you can return to it with renewed vigor later. $\", \"^ We know we must 'push our luck' sometimes. We tend to have some idea about what is appropriate and inappropriate when it comes to 'luck pushing'. Too little, and we risk making an opportunity slip from our grasp. Too much, and we risk making a situation unnecessarily complicated. You're right to test your luck boundaries and your instincts about how far are likely correct! $\", \"^ What's the rush? Where is urgency coming from? Perhaps, you don't see anywhere in your world where urgency is taking precedence. Maybe, you don't feel particularly anxious about where particular progress needs to be made. Maybe, that's the situation now. It's likely that, very soon, you will believe something to be more time sensitive than it appears currently. When that happens, remember that slow and steady really will win a particular race. Take it easy and slowly. $\", \"^ Have you loaded that latest software on your PC Gemini? Or is it a new device which requires you to spend a good hour, figuring out exactly how it works? If you've been delaying this kind of thing, you can be remarkably prepared today which can help you to catch up and get abreast. If a relative is a bit moody, try not to take too much notice. $\", \"^ Is it possible to have too many answers? If it's possible for us to be on the receiving end of too much information when we have something explained to us, then yes. You need to guard against confusion through 'information overload'. Someone feels obliged to overstate something. You need only the bare facts, nothing else. $\", \"^ Your efforts to bring a greater sense of security to your world, possibly financially, aren't being done solely with benefits to you in mind. You want others to benefit from what you're trying to put in place, but unless you put them in the picture about your vision and what you hope to achieve, they'll likely be none the wiser. Rather than reveal your strategy once it's further down the road, involve others at this early stage. Encouraging teamwork from the outset with something everyone stands to benefit from is a sensible strategy. $\", \"^ Imagine how dull life would be if you weren't experiencing uncertainty and drama the sky implies exist in your world. Sure, we can all say we experience both but you might be wondering how it came to be that you should be shouldering levels of responsibility you are. So, with that in mind, are you meant to simply accept it and carry on? Actually, through making something wonderful happen for someone else, you stand to make a valuable gain for yourself in some way. $\"]\n"
